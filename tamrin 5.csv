"Internet of things (IoT) has brought a greater transformation in health-care sector thereby improving patient care, minimizing treatment costs. The pre-sent method employs classical mechanisms for extracting features and a regression model for prediction. These methods have failed to consider the pollution aspects involved during COVID 19 prediction. Utilizing Ensemble Deep Learning and Framingham Feature Extraction (FFE) techniques, a smart health-care system is introduced for COVID-19 pandemic disease diagnosis. The Col-lected feature or data via predictive mechanisms to form pollution maps. Those maps are used to implement real-time countermeasures, such as storing the extracted data or feature in a Cloud server to minimize concentrations of air pol-lutants. Once integrated with patient management systems, this solution would minimize pollution emitted via patient’s sensors by offering spaces in the cloud server when pollution thresholds are reached. Second, the Gini Index factor information gain technique eliminates unimportant and redundant attributes while selecting the most relevant, reducing computing overhead and optimizing system performance. Finally, the COVID-19 disease prognosis ensemble deep learning-based classifier is constructed. Experimental analysis is planned to measure the prediction accuracy, error, precision and recall for different numbers of patients. Experimental results show that prediction accuracy is improved by 8%, error rate was reduced by 47% and prediction time is minimized by 36% compared to existing methods. © 2023, Tech Science Press.

"Green bonds are powerful tools for fighting against climate change and typically exhibit more volatility than conventional bonds do. However, the volatility forecasting of green bond has received little attention in previous literature. This study proposes two novel heterogeneous ensemble models, which differ from common volatility forecasting in that they are combine advanced tree-based ensemble models and exogenous predictors from other financial and commodity markets to forecast the volatility of green bonds. Validated on multiple green bonds indexes, loss functions, and time horizons, the comparative results show that the incorporation of exogenous predictors can enhance the predictive accuracy of volatility forecasting models, which is also confirmed by the marginal effects illustrated by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. The proposed EX-SEL model significantly outperforms the benchmark models in most cases. The results of the robustness check further indicate that the empirical results are robust to alternative volatility estimators, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and alternative selection strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Gradient boosting decision tree; Green bonds; Heterogeneous ensemble; Random forests; Volatility forecasting
"Background: Artificial intelligence-based disease prediction models have a greater potential to screen COVID-19 patients than conventional methods. However, their application has been restricted because of their underlying black-box nature. Objective: To addressed this issue, an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach was developed to screen patients for COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective study consisting of 1,737 participants (759 COVID-19 patients and 978 controls) admitted to San Raphael Hospital (OSR) from February to May 2020 was used to construct a diagnosis model. Finally, 32 key blood test indices from 1,374 participants were used for screening patients for COVID-19. Four ensemble learning algorithms were used: random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Feature importance from the perspective of the clinical domain and visualized interpretations were illustrated by using local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) plots. Results: The GBDT model [area under the curve (AUC): 86.4%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.821–0.907] outperformed the RF model (AUC: 85.7%; 95% CI 0.813–0.902), AdaBoost model (AUC: 85.4%; 95% CI 0.810–0.899), and XGBoost model (AUC: 84.9%; 95% CI 0.803–0.894) in distinguishing patients with COVID-19 from those without. The cumulative feature importance of lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cells, and eosinophil counts was 0.145, 0.130, and 0.128, respectively. Conclusions: Ensemble machining learning (ML) approaches, mainly GBDT and LIME plots, are efficient for screening patients with COVID-19 and might serve as a potential tool in the auxiliary diagnosis of COVID-19. Patients with higher WBC count, higher LDH level, or higher EOT count, were more likely to have COVID-19.

"This study was designed to develop machine?learning models to predict COVID?19 mortality and identify its key features based on clinical characteristics and laboratory tests. For this, deep?learning (DL) and machine?learning (ML) models were developed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) and F1 score optimization of 87 parameters. Of the two, the DL model exhibited better performance (AUC 0.8721, accuracy 0.84, and F1 score 0.76). However, we also blended DL with ML, and the ensemble model performed the best (AUC 0.8811, accuracy 0.85, and F1 score 0.77). The DL model is generally unable to extract feature importance; however, we succeeded by using the Shapley Additive exPlanations method for each model. This study demonstrated both the applicability of DL and ML models for classifying COVID?19 mortality using hospital?structured data and that the ensemble model had the best predictive ability. © 2022 by the authors.

"The COVID-19 precautions, lockdown, and quarantine implemented throughout the epidemic resulted in a worldwide economic disaster. People are facing unprecedented levels of intense threat, necessitating professional, systematic psychiatric intervention and assistance. New psychological services must be established as quickly as possible to support the mental healthcare needs of people in this pandemic condition. This study examines the contents of calls landed in the emergency response support system (ERSS) during the pandemic. Furthermore, a combined analysis of Twitter patterns connected to emergency services could be valuable in assisting people in this pandemic crisis and understanding and supporting people's emotions. The proposed Average Voting Ensemble Deep Learning model (AVEDL Model) is based on the Average Voting technique. The AVEDL Model is utilized to classify emotion based on COVID-19 associated emergency response support system calls (transcribed) along with tweets. Pre-trained transformer-based models BERT, DistilBERT, and RoBERTa are combined to build the AVEDL Model, which achieves the best results. The AVEDL Model is trained and tested for emotion detection using the COVID-19 labeled tweets and call content of the emergency response support system. This is the first deep learning ensemble model using COVID-19 emotion analysis to the best of our knowledge. The AVEDL Model outperforms standard deep learning and machine learning models by attaining an accuracy of 86.46 percent and Macro-average F1-score of 85.20 percent. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BERT; COVID-19; Deep learning; DistilBERT; Emergency response support system (ERSS); Emotion detection; Ensemble model; Health emergency; RoBERTa
"“Novel Coronavirus”, commonly known as COVID-19 has spread nearly to the entire world. The number of impacted cases and deaths has increased significantly in each country, posing a challenge for the world’s health organizations. The goal of this paper was to better comprehend and analyze the growth of the disease in India, including confirmed, recovered, fatalities, and active cases of COVID-19. Data analysis affects an organization’s decision-making process with interactive visual representation. The proposed model was an ensemble model that was built using linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression models. The model predicted the number of confirmed cases from 30th May 2021 to 15th June 2021 based on the data available from 22 January 2020 to 29 May 2021 and improved accuracy was obtained when compared with the actual data. Forecasting the confirmed cases might assist health organizations in planning medical facilities. Following that, an appropriate machine leraning (ML) model must be found that can predict the number of new cases in the future. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

"Recently the most infectious disease is the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID 19) creates a devastating effect on public health in more than 200 countries in the world. Since the detection of COVID19 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is time-consuming and error-prone, the alternative solution of detection is Computed Tomography (CT) images. In this paper, Contrast Limited Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) was applied to CT images as a preprocessing step for enhancing the quality of the images. After that, we developed a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that extracted 100 prominent features from a total of 2482 CT scan images. These extracted features were then deployed to various machine learning algorithms — Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). Finally, we proposed an ensemble model for the COVID19 CT image classification. We also showed various performance comparisons with the state-of-art methods. Our proposed model outperforms the state-of-art models and achieved an accuracy, precision, and recall score of 99.73%, 99.46%, and 100%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",CLAHE; Convolutional Neural Network; COVID19; Ensemble learning; Feature scaling; Guassian Naive Bayes; Soft voting; Support Vector Machine
"The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is an infectious pulmonary disorder, has affected millions of people and has been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. Due to highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and its high possibility of causing severe conditions in the patients, the development of rapid and accurate diagnostic tools have gained importance. The real-time reverse transcription-polymerize chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the presence of Coronavirus RNA by using the mucus and saliva mixture samples taken by the nasopharyngeal swab technique. But, RT-PCR suffers from having low-sensitivity especially in the early stage. Therefore, the usage of chest radiography has been increasing in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 due to its fast imaging speed, significantly low cost and low dosage exposure of radiation. In our study, a computer-aided diagnosis system for X-ray images based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ensemble learning idea, which can be used by radiologists as a supporting tool in COVID-19 detection, has been proposed. Deep feature sets extracted by using seven CNN architectures were concatenated for feature level fusion and fed to multiple classifiers in terms of decision level fusion idea with the aim of discriminating COVID-19, pneumonia and no-finding classes. In the decision level fusion idea, a majority voting scheme was applied to the resultant decisions of classifiers. The obtained accuracy values and confusion matrix based evaluation criteria were presented for three progressively created data-sets. The aspects of the proposed method that are superior to existing COVID-19 detection studies have been discussed and the fusion performance of proposed approach was validated visually by using Class Activation Mapping technique. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has attained high COVID-19 detection performance that was proven by its comparable accuracy and superior precision/recall values with the existing studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Class activation mapping; Convolutional neural networks; COVID-19; Decision level fusion; Ensemble learning; Feature level fusion; Multistage learning; Support vector machines; Transfer learning
"Purpose: Fuel demand forecast is a fundamental tool to guide private planning actions and public policies aim to guarantee energy supply. This paper aims to evaluate different forecasting methods to project the consumption of light fuels in Brazil (fuel used by vehicles with internal combustion engine). Design/methodology/approach: Eight different methods were implemented, besides of ensemble learning technics that combine the different models. The evaluation was carried out based on the forecast error for a forecast horizon of 3, 6 and 12 months. Findings: The statistical tests performed indicated the superiority of the evaluated models compared to a naive forecasting method. As the forecast horizon increase, the heterogeneity between the accuracy of the models becomes evident and the classification by performance becomes easier. Furthermore, for 12 months forecast, it was found methods that outperform, with statistical significance, the SARIMA method, that is widely used. Even with an unprecedented event, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the results proved to be robust. Practical implications: Some regulation instruments in Brazilian fuel market requires the forecast of light fuel consumption to better deal with supply and environment issues. In that context, the level of accuracy reached allows the use of these models as tools to assist public and private agents that operate in this market. Originality/value: The study seeks to fill a gap in the literature on the Brazilian light fuel market. In addition, the methodological strategy adopted assesses projection models from different areas of knowledge using a robust evaluation procedure. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Autoregressive; Biofuels; Co-integration; Demand forecasting; Demand-side management; Econometric; Forecast evaluation; Forecasting; Forecasting methods; Fuel demand; Fuzzy-logic model; Gasoline; Liquid fuels; Machine learning; Neural networks; Time series; Time series analysis
"Short-term forecasting of the COVID-19 pandemic is required to facilitate the planning of COVID-19 health care demand in hospitals. Here, we evaluate the performance of 12 individual models and 19 predictors to anticipate French COVID-19-related health care needs from September 7, 2020, toMarch 6, 2021.We then build an ensemble model by combining the individual forecasts and retrospectively test this model from March 7, 2021, to July 6, 2021. We find that the inclusion of early predictors (epidemiological, mobility, and meteorological predictors) can halve the rms error for 14-d-ahead forecasts, with epidemiological and mobility predictors contributing the most to the improvement. On average, the ensemble model is the best or second-best model, depending on the evaluation metric. Our approach facilitates the comparison and benchmarking of competing models through their integration in a coherent analytical framework, ensuring that avenues for future improvements can be identified. © 2022 the Author(s).",COVID-19; ensemble model; forecasting
"Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19–related keywords and then using vaccine- and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule–based and deep learning–based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes. ©Zain Hussain, Zakariya Sheikh, Ahsen Tahir, Kia Dashtipour, Mandar Gogate, Aziz Sheikh, Amir Hussain.",artificial intelligence; COVID-19; deep learning; Facebook; health informatics; infodemiology; natural language processing; public health; sentiment analysis; social media; Twitter; vaccination
"A healthcare monitoring system needs the support of recent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This global pandemic has already taken millions of lives. Both infected and uninfected people have generated big data where AI and ML can use to combat and detect COVID-19 at an early stage. Motivated by this, an improved ML framework for the early detection of this disease is proposed in this paper. The state-of-the-art Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm with an improved objective function is proposed and applied to optimize the hyperparameters of the ML algorithms, namely HHO-based eXtreme gradient boosting (HHOXGB), light gradient boosting (HHOLGB), categorical boosting (HHOCAT), random forest (HHORF) and support vector classifier (HHOSVC). An ensemble technique was applied to these optimized ML models to improve the prediction performance. Our proposed method was applied to publicly available big COVID-19 data and yielded a prediction accuracy of 92.38% using the ensemble model. In contrast, HHOXGB provided the highest accuracy of 92.23% as a single optimized model. The performance of the proposed method was compared with the traditional algorithms and other ML-based methods. In both cases, our proposed method performed better. Furthermore, not only the classification improvement, but also the features are analyzed in terms of feature importance calculated by SHapely adaptive exPlanations (SHAP) values. A graphical user interface is also discussed as a potential tool for nonspecialist users such as clinical staff and nurses.

"Urban air pollution is a health hazard linked to anthropogenic emissions. Reliable evaluation of changes in pollutants due to altered emissions requires considering meteorological and other variability influencing concentrations. Here, a combination of ensemble learning, competitive learning and unsupervised clustering is proposed and applied to leverage the change analysis of particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms Random Forest (RF) and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) were trained with historical meteorological data, pollutant concentrations and traffic indicators. The importance of different variables for local PM2.5 was determined with RF. SOM was configured for multivariable cluster analysis. The trained SOM enabled predicting a cluster for new data representing conditions with shifted anthropogenic activity. The prediction forms a benchmark for the analysed period with maximized meteorological similarity, which facilitates identifying changes in ambient pollutants due to changed emissions. The method was applied to data from the start of COVID-19 pandemic, 3/2020, when emissions suddenly decreased. For measurements from Helsinki, Finland, the SOM yielded a statistically significant change in PM2.5 (?0.7%), NO2 (?33%) and O3 (+17%). Comparing data from 3/2020 to data from 3/2017–2019 produced different results (PM2.5 ?1.7%, NO2 ?37%, O3 ?4.0%). Statistical indicators confirmed better compatibility between the analysed period and its benchmark when using the SOM prediction instead of calendar-based selection: Average RMSRE was 19%-points lower and Willmott's dr 41% higher with SOM than with 3/2017–2019. Based on the case study and method evaluation, using ML for multivariate analysis of changed air pollution is feasible and yields meaningful results. © 2022 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control",Air pollution; Change analysis; Particulate matter; Random forest; Self-organizing map
"Deep learning models demonstrate superior performance in image classification problems. COVID-19 image classification is developed using single deep learning models. In this paper, an efficient hardware architecture based on an ensemble deep learning model is built to identify the COVID-19 using chest X-ray (CXR) records. Five deep learning models namely ResNet, fitness, IRCNN (Inception Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network), effectiveness, and Fitnet are ensembled for fine-tuning and enhancing the performance of the COVID-19 identification; these models are chosen as they individually perform better in other applications. Experimental analysis shows that the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 for COVID-19 detection are 0.99,0.98,0.98, and 0.98 respectively. An application-specific hardware architecture incorporates the pipeline, parallel processing, reusability of computational resources by carefully exploiting the data flow and resource availability. The processing element (PE) and the CNN architecture are modeled using Verilog, simulated, and synthesized using cadence with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 90 nm tech file. The simulated results show a 40% reduction in the latency and number of clock cycles. The computations and power consumptions are minimized by designing the PE as a data-aware unit. Thus, the proposed architecture is best suited for Covid-19 prediction and diagnosis. © 2022",Accuracy; COVID-19; Data-aware computational unit; Deep learning; Ensemble; Latency of CNN; Performance; Pre-training
SignificanceThis paper compares the probabilistic accuracy of short-term forecasts of reported deaths due to COVID-19 during the first year and a half of the pandemic in the United States. Results show high variation in accuracy between and within stand-alone models and more consistent accuracy from an ensemble model that combined forecasts from all eligible models. This demonstrates that an ensemble model provided a reliable and comparatively accurate means of forecasting deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic that exceeded the performance of all of the models that contributed to it.

"User-generated content on numerous sites is indicative of users’ sentiment towards many issues, from daily food intake to using new products. Amid the active usage of social networks and micro-blogs, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic, we may glean insights into any product or service through users’ feedback and opinions. Thus, it is often difficult and time consuming to go through all the reviews and analyse them in order to recognize the notion of the overall goodness or badness of the reviews before making any decision. To overcome this challenge, sentiment analysis has been used as an effective rapid way to automatically gauge consumers’ opinions. Large reviews will possibly encompass both positive and negative opinions on different features of a product/service in the same review. Therefore, this paper proposes an aspect-oriented sentiment classification using a combination of the prior knowledge topic model algorithm (SA-LDA), automatic labelling (SentiWordNet) and ensemble method (Stacking). The framework is evaluated using the dataset from different domains. The results have shown that the proposed SA-LDA outperformed the standard LDA. In addition, the suggested ensemble learning classifier has increased the accuracy of the classifier by more than ~3% when it is compared to baseline classification algorithms. The study concluded that the proposed approach is equally adaptable across multi-domain applications. © 2022 by the authors.

"Education is an important domain that may be improved by analyzing the sentiments of learners and educators. Evaluating the sustainability of the education system is critical for the continuous improvement and satisfaction of the learner’s community. This research work focused on the evaluation of the effectiveness of the online education system that has been adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, sentiments/reviews of learners were collected from the Twitter website regarding the education domain during COVID-19. To automate the process of evaluation, a hybrid approach was applied that used a knowledgebase of opinion words along with machine learning and boosting algorithms with n-grams (unigram, bigram, trigram and combination of all these n-grams). This automated approach helped to evaluate the transition of the education system in different circumstances. An ensemble classifier was created in combination with a customized knowledgebase using classifiers that individually performed best with each of the n-grams. Due to the imbalanced nature of the data (tweets), these operations were performed by applying the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The obtained results show that the use of a customized knowledgebase not only improved the performance of the individual classifiers but also produced quality results with the ensemble model. As per the observed results, the online education system was not found sustainable as the majority of the learners were badly affected due to some important aspects (health issues, lack of training and resources). © 2022 by the authors.

"The use of face masks has increased dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic started in order to to curb the spread of the disease. Additionally, breakthrough infections caused by the Delta and Omicron variants have further increased the importance of wearing a face mask, even for vaccinated individuals. However, the use of face masks also induces attenuation in speech signals, and this change may impact speech processing technologies, e.g., automated speaker verification (ASV) and speech to text conversion. In this paper we examine Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems against the speech samples in the presence of three different types of face mask: surgical, cloth, and filtered N95, and analyze the impact on acoustics and other factors. In addition, we explore the effect of different microphones, and distance from the microphone, and the impact of face masks when speakers use ASV systems in real-world scenarios. Our analysis shows a significant deterioration in performance when an ASV system encounters different face masks, microphones, and variable distance between the subject and microphone. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel framework to overcome performance degradation in these scenarios by realigning the ASV system. The novelty of the proposed ASV framework is as follows: first, we propose a fused feature descriptor by concatenating the novel Ternary Deviated overlapping Patterns (TDoP), Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and Gammatone Cepstral Coefficients (GTCC), which are used by both the ensemble learning-based ASV and anomaly detection system in the proposed ASV architecture. Second, this paper proposes an anomaly detection model for identifying vocal samples produced in the presence of face masks. Next, it presents a Peak Norm (PN) filter to approximate the signal of the speaker without a face mask in order to boost the accuracy of ASV systems. Finally, the features of filtered samples utilizing the PN filter and samples without face masks are passed to the proposed ASV to test for improved accuracy. The proposed ASV system achieved an accuracy of 0.99 and 0.92, respectively, on samples recorded without a face mask and with different face masks. Although the use of face masks affects the ASV system, the PN filtering solution overcomes this deficiency up to 4%. Similarly, when exposed to different microphones and distances, the PN approach enhanced system accuracy by up to 7% and 9%, respectively. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework against an in-house prepared, diverse Multi Speaker Face Masks (MSFM) dataset, (IRB No. FY2021-83), consisting of samples of subjects taken with a variety of face masks and microphones, and from different distances. © 2022 by the authors.

"The COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the significance of sanitization and maintaining hygienic access to clean water to reduce mortality and morbidity cases worldwide. Diarrhea is one of the prevalent waterborne diseases caused due to contaminated water in many low-income countries with similar living conditions. According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is among the top five primary causes of death worldwide in low-income nations. The condition affects people in every age group due to a lack of proper water used for daily living. In this study, a stacking ensemble machine learning model was employed against traditional models to extract clinical knowledge for better understanding patients’ characteristics; disease prevalence; hygienic conditions; quality of water used for cooking, bathing, and toiletries; chemicals used; therapist’s medications; and symptoms that are reflected in the field study data. Results revealed that the ensemble model provides higher accuracy with 98.90% as part of training and testing phases when experimented against frequently used J48, Naïve Bayes, SVM, NN, PART, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models. Managing outcomes of this research in the early stages could assist people in low-income countries to have a better lifestyle, fewer infections, and minimize expensive hospital visits. © 2022 by the author.

"In December 2019, Severe Special Infectious Pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2)–the novel coron-avirus (COVID-19)– appeared for the first time, breaking out in Wuhan, China, and the epidemic spread quickly to the world in a very short period time. According to WHO data, ten million people have been infected, and more than one million people have died; moreover, the economy has also been severely hit. In an outbreak of an epidemic, people are concerned about the final number of infections. Therefore, effectively predicting the number of confirmed cases in the future can provide a reference for decision-makers to make decisions and avoid the spread of deadly epidemics. In recent years, the ?-Sutte indicator method is an excellent predictor in short-term forecasting; however, the ?-Sutte indicator uses fixed static weights. In this study, by adding an error-based dynamic weighting method, a novel ?-Sutte indicator is proposed. Combined with ARIMA as an ensemble model (?SA), the forecasting of the future COVID-19 daily cumulative number of cases and the number of new cases in the US are evaluated from the experiment. The experimental results show that the forecasting accuracy of ?SA proposed in this study is better than other methods in forecasting with metrics MAPE and RMSE. It proves the feasibility of adding error-based dynamic weights in the ?-Sutte indicator in the area of forecasting. © 2022 by the authors.

"Current research endeavors in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) methods in the diagnosis of the COVID-19 disease has proven indispensable with very promising results. Despite these promising results, there are still limitations in real-time detection of COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test data, such as limited datasets, imbalance classes, a high misclassification rate of models, and the need for specialized research in identifying the best features and thus improving prediction rates. This study aims to investigate and apply the ensemble learning approach to develop prediction models for effective detection of COVID-19 using routine laboratory blood test results. Hence, an ensemble machine learning-based COVID-19 detection system is presented, aiming to aid clinicians to diagnose this virus effectively. The experiment was conducted using custom convolutional neural network (CNN) models as a first-stage classifier and 15 supervised machine learning algorithms as a second-stage classifier: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (Linear and RBF), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, MultiLayer Perceptron, AdaBoost, ExtraTrees, Logistic Regression, Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (LDA/QDA), Passive, Ridge, and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier. Our findings show that an ensemble learning model based on DNN and ExtraTrees achieved a mean accuracy of 99.28% and area under curve (AUC) of 99.4%, while AdaBoost gave a mean accuracy of 99.28% and AUC of 98.8% on the San Raffaele Hospital dataset, respectively. The comparison of the proposed COVID-19 detection approach with other state-of-the-art approaches using the same dataset shows that the proposed method outperforms several other COVID-19 diagnostics methods. © 2022 by the authors.

"COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, resulting in endless efforts to reduce infections, fatalities, and therapies to mitigate its after-effects. Currently, large and fast-paced vaccination campaigns are in the process to reduce COVID-19 infection and fatality risks. Despite recommendations from governments and medical experts, people show conceptions and perceptions regarding vaccination risks and share their views on social media platforms. Such opinions can be analyzed to determine social trends and devise policies to increase vaccination acceptance. In this regard, this study proposes a methodology for analyzing the global perceptions and perspectives towards COVID-19 vaccination using a worldwide Twitter dataset. The study relies on two techniques to analyze the sentiments: natural language processing and machine learning. To evaluate the performance of the different lexicon-based methods, different machine and deep learning models are studied. In addition, for sentiment classification, the proposed ensemble model named long short-term memory-gated recurrent neural network (LSTM-GRNN) is a combination of LSTM, gated recurrent unit, and recurrent neural networks.

"As influenza viruses mutate rapidly, a prediction model for potential outbreaks of influenza-like illnesses helps detect the spread of the illnesses in real time. In order to create a better prediction model, in this study, in addition to using the traditional hydrological and atmospheric data, features, such as popular search keywords on Google Trends, public holiday information, population density, air quality indices, and the numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases, were also used to train the model in this research. Furthermore, Random Forest and XGBoost were combined and used in the proposed prediction model to increase the prediction accuracy. The training data used in this research were the historical data taken from 2016 to 2021. In our experiments, different combinations of features were tested. The results show that features, such as popular search keywords on Google Trends, the numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases, and air quality indices can improve the outcome of the prediction model. The evaluation results showed that the error rate between the predicted results and the actual number of influenza-like cases form Week 15 to Week 18 fell to less than 5%. The outbreak of COVID-19 in Taiwan began in Week 19 and resulted in a sharp rise in the number of clinic or hospital visits by patients of influenza-like illnesses. After that, from Week 21 to Week 26, the error rate between the predicted and actual numbers of influenza-like cases in the later period dropped down to 13%. It can be confirmed from the actual experimental results in this research that the use of the ensemble learning prediction model proposed in this research can accurately predict the trend of influenza-like cases. © 2022 by the authors.

"Ozone (O3) is an important trace and greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, posing a threat to the ecological environment and human health at the ground level. Large-scale and long-term studies of O3 pollution in China are few due to highly limited direct ground and satellite measurements. This study offers a new perspective to estimate ground-level O3 from solar radiation intensity and surface temperature by employing an extended ensemble learning of the space-time extremely randomized trees (STET) model, together with ground-based observations, remote sensing products, atmospheric reanalysis, and an emission inventory. A full-coverage (100%), high-resolution (10 km) and high-quality daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) ground-level O3 dataset covering China (called ChinaHighO3) from 2013 to 2020 was generated. Our MDA8 O3 estimates (predictions) are reliable, with an average out-of-sample (out-of-station) coefficient of determination of 0.87 (0.80) and root-mean-square error of 17.10 (21.10) ?g/m3 in China. The unique advantage of the full coverage of our dataset allowed us to accurately capture a short-term severe O3 pollution exposure event that took place from 23 April to 8 May in 2020. Also, a rapid increase and recovery of O3 concentrations associated with variations in anthropogenic emissions were seen during and after the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. Trends in O3 concentration showed an average growth rate of 2.49 ?g/m3/yr (p &lt; 0.001) from 2013 to 2020, along with the continuous expansion of polluted areas exceeding the daily O3 standard (i.e., MDA8 O3 = 160 ?g/m3). Summertime O3 concentrations and the probability of occurrence of daily O3 pollution have significantly increased since 2015, especially in the North China Plain and the main air pollution transmission belt (i.e., the “2 + 26” cities). However, a decline in both was seen in 2020, mainly due to the coordinated control of air pollution and ongoing COVID-19 effects. This carefully vetted and smoothed dataset is valuable for studies on air pollution and environmental health in China. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Air pollution; China; COVID-19; Ensemble learning; Ozone
"Due to the continuous and growing spread of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) worldwide, it is urgent, especially in the data science era, to develop accurate data driven decision-aided methods to predict and early detect the outbreak of this epidemic disease and then to support healthcare decision makers. In this context, the main goal of this paper is to build an accurate and generic data driven method that can predict daily COVID-19 positive cases and therefore helps stakeholders to make and review their epidemic response plans. This method is based on the integration of three deep learning models: Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and takes advantage of their complementarity. The proposed method is validated on two experimental scenarios where the first one aims to validate the method on China and Tunisia case studies and the second one is based on data fusion and transfer learning process where China data and models will be reused to predict Tunisia COVID-19 outbreak. Experiment results indicate that, compared with individual learners, the stacked-DNN meta-learner, whose inputs are results of LSTM, DNN and CNN learners, achieved the best results in terms of accuracy as well as RMSE and it required the lowest time for training as well as prediction for the two scenarios. The main outcomes of this paper are i) to adopt deep learning models combined to stacking ensemble learning to accurately forecast COVID-19 positive cases and ii) to merge data and to adopt transfer learning for the prediction of confirmed cases by reusing China data, learners and meat-learners to make prediction of the epidemic trend for other countries, with less facilities of collecting data, when preventive and control measures are similar. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",COVID-19; Data fusion; Deep ensemble learning; Epidemic diseases outbreak; Models integration; Transfer learning
"Human activity recognition (HAR) can monitor persons at risk of COVID?19 virus infec-tion to manage their activity status. Currently, many people are isolated at home or quarantined in some specified places due to the spread of COVID?19 virus all over the world. This situation raises the requirement of using the HAR to observe physical activity levels to assess physical and mental health. This study proposes an ensemble learning algorithm (ELA) to perform activity recognition using the signals recorded by smartphone sensors. The proposed ELA combines a gated recurrent unit (GRU), a convolutional neural network (CNN) stacked on the GRU and a deep neural network (DNN). The input samples of DNN were an extra feature vector consisting of 561 time?domain and frequency?domain parameters. The full connected DNN was used to fuse three models for the activity classification. The experimental results show that the precision, recall, F1?score and accuracy achieved by the ELA are 96.8%, 96.8%, 96.8%, and 96.7%, respectively, which are superior to the existing schemes. © 2022 by the authors.

"Deep learning based analyses of computed tomography (CT) images contribute to automated diagnosis of COVID-19, and ensemble learning may commonly provide a better solution. Here, we proposed an ensemble learning method that integrates several component neural networks to jointly diagnose COVID-19. Two ensemble strategies are considered: the output scores of all component models that are combined with the weights adjusted adaptively by cost function back propagation; voting strategy. A database containing 8 347 CT slices of COVID-19, common pneumonia and normal subjects was used as training and testing sets. Results show that the novel method can reach a high accuracy of 99.37% (recall: 0.9981, precision: 0.989 3), with an increase of about 7% in comparison to single-component models. And the average test accuracy is 95.62% (recall: 0.958 7, precision: 0.955 9), with a corresponding increase of 5.2%. Compared with several latest deep learning models on the identical test set, our method made an accuracy improvement up to 10.88%.

"COVID-19 disease is a major health calamity in twentieth century, in which the infection is spreading at the global level. Developing countries like Bangladesh, India, and others are still facing a delay in recognizing COVID-19 cases. Hence, there is a need for immediate recognition with perfect identification of infection. This clear visualization helps to save the life of suspected COVID-19 patients. With the help of traditional RT-PCR testing, the combination of medical images and deep learning classifiers delivers more hopeful results with high accuracy in the prediction and recognition of COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 disease is recently researched through sample chest X-ray images, which have already proven its efficiency in lung diseases. To emphasize corona virus testing methods and to control the community spreading, the automatic detection process of COVID-19 is processed through the detailed medication reports from medical images. Although there are numerous challenges in the manual understanding of traces in COVID-19 infection from X-ray, the subtle differences among normal and infected X-rays can be traced by the data patterns of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To improve the detection performance of CNN, this paper plans to develop an Ensemble Learning with CNN-based Deep Features (EL-CNN-DF). In the initial phase, image scaling and median filtering perform the pre-processing of the chest X-ray images gathered from the benchmark source. The second phase is lung segmentation, which is the significant step for COVID detection. It is accomplished by the Adaptive Activation Function-based U-Net (AAF-U-Net). Once the lungs are segmented, it is subjected to novel EL-CNN-DF, in which the deep features are extracted from the pooling layer of CNN, and the fully connected layer of CNN are replaced with the three classifiers termed “Support Vector Machine (SVM), Autoencoder, Naive Bayes (NB)”. The final detection of COVID-19 is done by these classifiers, in which high ranking strategy is utilized. As a modification, a Self Adaptive-Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (SA-TSA) is adopted as a boosting algorithm to enhance the performance of segmentation and detection. The overall analysis has shown that the precision of the enhanced CNN by using SA-TSA was 1.02%, 4.63%, 3.38%, 1.62%, 1.51% and 1.04% better than SVM, autoencoder, NB, Ensemble, RNN and LSTM respectively. The comparative performance analysis on existing model proves that the proposed algorithm is better than other algorithms in terms of segmentation and classification of COVID-19 detection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Adaptive Activation Function-based U-Net; Autoencoder; Convolutional Neural Network; COVID-19 Detection; Ensemble Learning with CNN-based Deep Features; Naive Bayes; Self Adaptive- Tunicate Swarm Algorithm; Support Vector Machine
"The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has left the world to a standstill by creating a calamitous situation. To mitigate this devastating effect the inception of artificial intelligence into medical health care is mandatory. This study aims to present the educational perspective of Covid-19 and forecast the number of confirmed and death cases in the USA, India, and Brazil along with the discussion of endothelial dysfunction in epithelial cells and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) with the Covid-19. Three different deep learning based experimental setups have been framed to forecast Covid-19. Models are (i) Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) (ii) Convolutional LSTM (iii) Proposed ensemble of Convolutional and Bi-directional LSTM network are known as CoBiD-Net ensemble. The educational perspective of Covid-19 has been given along with an architectural discussion of multi-organ failure due to intrusion of Covid-19 with the cell receptors of the human body. Different classification metrics have been calculated using all three models. Proposed CoBiD-Net ensemble model outperforms the other two models with respect to accuracy and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Using CoBiD-Net ensemble, accuracy for Covid-19 cases ranges from 98.10 to 99.13% with MAPE ranges from 0.87 to 1.90.

"Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been spread widely in the world, causing a huge threat to the living environment of people. Objective: Under CT imaging, the structure features of COVID-19 lesions are complicated and varied greatly in different cases. To accurately locate COVID-19 lesions and assist doctors to make the best diagnosis and treatment plan, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented for COVID-19 lesion segmentation in CT images. Methods: Since a large number of COVID-19 CT images and the corresponding lesion annotations are difficult to obtain, a transfer learning strategy is employed to make up for the shortcoming and alleviate the overfitting problem. Based on the reality that traditional single deep learning framework is difficult to extract complicated and varied COVID-19 lesion features effectively that may cause some lesions to be undetected. To overcome the problem, a deep-supervised ensemble learning network is presented to combine with local and global features for COVID-19 lesion segmentation. Results: The performance of the proposed method was validated in experiments with a publicly available dataset. Compared with manual annotations, the proposed method acquired a high intersection over union (IoU) of 0.7279 and a low Hausdorff distance (H) of 92.4604. Conclusion: A deep-supervised ensemble learning network was presented for coronavirus pneumonia lesion segmentation in CT images. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by visual inspection and quantitative evaluation. Experimental results indicated that the proposed method has a good performance in COVID-19 lesion segmentation.

"The Covid-19 pandemic is a deadly epidemic and continues to affect all world. This situation dragged the countries into a global crisis and caused the collapse of some health systems. Therefore, many technologies are needed to slow down the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and produce solutions. In this context, some developments have been made with artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning support systems in order to alleviate the burden on the health system. In this study, a new Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework is proposed for the detection and early prevention of Covid-19 infection. In the proposed IoMT framework, a Covid-19 scenario consisting of various numbers of sensors is created in the Riverbed Modeler simulation software. The health data produced in this scenario are analyzed in real time with Apache Spark technology, and disease prediction is made. In order to provide more accurate results for Covid-19 disease prediction, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT) Ensemble Learning classifiers, which are formed by Decision Tree classifiers, are compared for the performance evaluation. In addition, throughput, end-to-end delay results and Apache Spark data processing performance of heterogeneous nodes with different priorities are analyzed in the Covid-19 scenario. The MongoDB NoSQL database is used in the IoMT framework to store big health data produced in real time and use it in subsequent processes. The proposed IoMT framework experimental results show that the GBTs classifier has the best performance with 95.70% training, 95.30% test accuracy and 0.970 area under the curve (AUC) values. Moreover, the promising real-time performances of wireless body area network (WBAN) simulation scenario and Apache Spark show that they can be used for the early detection of Covid-19 disease. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Apache spark; Covid-19 diagnosis; Ensemble learning; Machine learning; Real-time analytics
"In this research, we explored various state-of-the-art biomedical-specific pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models for the National Library of Medicine - Chemistry (NLM CHEM) and LitCovid tracks in the BioCreative VII Challenge, and propose a BERT-based ensemble learning approach to integrate the advantages of various models to improve the system's performance.

"This paper proposes a multichannel deep learning approach for lung disease detection using chest X-rays. The multichannel models used in this work are EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB1, and EfficientNetB2 pretrained models. The features from EfficientNet models are fused together. Next, the fused features are passed into more than one non-linear fully connected layer. Finally, the features passed into a stacked ensemble learning classifier for lung disease detection. The stacked ensemble learning classifier contains random forest and SVM in the first stage and logistic regression in the second stage for lung disease detection. The performance of the proposed method is studied in detail for more than one lung disease such as pneumonia, Tuberculosis (TB), and COVID-19. The performances of the proposed method for lung disease detection using chest X-rays compared with similar methods with the aim to show that the method is robust and has the capability to achieve better performances. In all the experiments on lung disease, the proposed method showed better performance and outperformed similar lung disease existing methods. This indicates that the proposed method is robust and generalizable on unseen chest X-rays data samples. To ensure that the features learnt by the proposed method is optimal, t-SNE feature visualization was shown on all three lung disease models. Overall, the proposed method has shown 98% detection accuracy for pediatric pneumonia lung disease, 99% detection accuracy for TB lung disease, and 98% detection accuracy for COVID-19 lung disease. The proposed method can be used as a tool for point-of-care diagnosis by healthcare radiologists.Journal instruction requires a city for affiliations; however, this is missing in affiliation 3.

"The world is currently facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 pandemic). Forecasting the progression of that pandemic is integral to planning the necessary next steps by governments and organizations. Recent studies have examined the factors that may impact COVID-19 forecasting and others have built models for predicting the numbers of active cases, recovered cases and deaths. The aim of this study was to improve the forecasting predictions by developing an ensemble machine-learning model that can be utilized in addition to the Naïve Bayes classifier, which is one of the simplest and fastest probabilistic classifiers. The first ensemble model combined gradient boosting and random forest classifiers and the second combined support vector machine and random-forest classifiers. The numbers of confirmed, recovered and death cases will be predicted for a period of 10 days. The results will be compared to the findings of previous studies. The results showed that the ensemble algorithm that combined gradient boosting and random-forest classifiers achieved the best performance, with 99% accuracy in all cases. © 2022, Scientific Research Support Fund of Jordan.

"The coronavirus (Covid-19) epidemic continues to have a negative influence on the global population's well-being and health. Scientists in many fields around the world are working non-stop to find a solution to the prevention of this epidemic. In the field of computer science, this struggle is supported by studies on especially the analysis of X-ray and CT images with artificial intelligence. In this study, two different ensemble learning models, including deep learning and a combination of machine learning methods, are presented for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection from X-ray images. The main purpose of this study is to increase the classification ability of Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResCNN), which is used as a deep learning method, with the assist of machine learning algorithms and extracted features from images. The proposed models were validated on a total of 5228 chest X-ray images categorized as Normal, Pneumonia, and Covid-19. The images in the dataset were sized in four different ways, 32 × 32, 64 × 64, 128 × 128, and 256 × 256, in order to analyze the validity of the proposed models in more detail. These four datasets were partitioned with the 10-fold cross-validation technique and converted into a total of 40 training and test data. Both proposed models use features derived from the ResCNN as the basis and test a certain number of machine learning algorithms with a majority voting technique by dividing them into subsets. In the architecture of the second model, it combines the features extracted from the Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) methods in addition to the features obtained from the ResCNN. It has been seen that the classification ability of both proposed models is better than the ResCNN in the experiments. In particular, the second model gives a similar classification score even though it is tested with images four-times smaller (e.g., 32 × 32 vs. 128 × 128) than those used in the ResCNN. This shows that the model can give ideal results with lower computational cost. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",convolutional neural network; Covid-19; histogram-oriented gradients; local binary patterns; machine learning; X-ray images
"Background: Radiological techniques integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) are a promising diagnostic tool for the rapidly increasing number of COVID-19 cases today. In this study, we intended to construct an artificial intelligence-assisted prediction of COVID-19 status based on thorax computed tomography (CT) scans using a proposed meta-learning strategy. Methods: A public dataset including 1252 positive and 1230 negative thorax CT scans of SARS-CoV-2 was used in the current study. The CT images for COVID-19 status were analyzed by 26 transfer learning (TL) models. The stacking ensemble learning was used to obtain more consistent and high-performance prediction results by combining the prediction results of 26 TL models with an embedded XGBoost algorithm. Results: Mobile had the best prediction with an accuracy of 0.946 (95% CI: 0.93-0.962) among the TL models. The Meta-learning model yielded the best classification accuracy of 0.993 (0.98-1), which outperformed MobileNet, the most successful architecture among TL architectures. Conclusions: The proposed meta-model that can distinguish CT images between COVID-19 positive and abnormal/normal conditions due to other etiology of COVID-19 negative may be beneficial in such pandemics. The AI application in this study can be used in mobile, desktop, and web-based platforms to have facilitating and complementary effects on classical reporting and the current workload in radiology departments. © 2022 A.

"One of the most difficult research areas in today's healthcare industry to combat the coronavirus pandemic is accurate COVID-19 detection. Because of its low infection miss rate and high sensitivity, chest computed tomography (CT) imaging has been recommended as a viable technique for COVID-19 diagnosis in a number of recent clinical investigations. This article presents an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based platform for improving and speeding up COVID-19 identification. Clinical devices are connected to network resources in the suggested IoMT platform using cloud computing. The method enables patients and healthcare experts to work together in real time to diagnose and treat COVID-19, potentially saving time and effort for both patients and physicians. In this paper, we introduce a technique for classifying chest CT scan images into COVID, pneumonia, and normal classes that use a Sugeno fuzzy integral ensemble across three transfer learning models, namely SqueezeNet, DenseNet-201, and MobileNetV2. The suggested fuzzy ensemble techniques outperform each individual transfer learning methodology as well as trainable ensemble strategies in terms of accuracy. The suggested MobileNetV2 fused with Sugeno fuzzy integral ensemble model has a 99.15% accuracy rate.

"The increase in people’s use of mobile messaging services has led to the spread of social engineering attacks like phishing, considering that spam text is one of the main factors in the dissemination of phishing attacks to steal sensitive data such as credit cards and passwords. In addition, rumors and incorrect medical information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are widely shared on social media leading to people’s fear and confusion. Thus, filtering spam content is vital to reduce risks and threats. Previous studies relied on machine learning and deep learning approaches for spam classification, but these approaches have two limitations. Machine learning models require manual feature engineering, whereas deep neural networks require a high computational cost. This paper introduces a dynamic deep ensemble model for spam detection that adjusts its complexity and extracts features automatically. The proposed model utilizes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction along with base classifiers such as random forests and extremely randomized trees for classifying texts into spam or legitimate ones. Moreover, the model employs ensemble learning procedures like boosting and bagging. As a result, the model achieved high precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy of 98.38%. © 2022, The Author(s).",Deep learning; Ensemble methods; Machine learning; Spam classification; Text messages
"Since the COVID-19 pandemic, several research studies have proposed Deep Learning (DL)-based automated COVID-19 detection, reporting high cross-validation accuracy when classifying COVID-19 patients from normal or other common Pneumonia. Although the reported outcomes are very high in most cases, these results were obtained without an independent test set from a separate data source(s). DL models are likely to overfit training data distribution when independent test sets are not utilized or are prone to learn dataset-specific artifacts rather than the actual disease characteristics and underlying pathology. This study aims to assess the promise of such DL methods and datasets by investigating the key challenges and issues by examining the compositions of the available public image datasets and designing different experimental setups. A convolutional neural network-based network, called CVR-Net (COVID-19 Recognition Network), has been proposed for conducting comprehensive experiments to validate our hypothesis. The presented end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model that aggregates the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to convey the final prediction probability. Three different classification tasks, such as 2-, 3-, 4-classes, are designed where the train–test datasets are from the single, multiple, and independent sources. The obtained binary classification accuracy is 99.8% for a single train–test data source, where the accuracies fall to 98.4% and 88.7% when multiple and independent train–test data sources are utilized. Similar outcomes are noticed in multi-class categorization tasks for single, multiple, and independent data sources, highlighting the challenges in developing DL models with the existing public datasets without an independent test set from a separate dataset. Such a result concludes a requirement for a better-designed dataset for developing DL tools applicable in actual clinical settings. The dataset should have an independent test set; for a single machine or hospital source, have a more balanced set of images for all the prediction classes; and have a balanced dataset from several hospitals and demography. Our source codes and model are publicly available1 for the research community for further improvements. © 2022 The Authors",Chest computed tomography and X-ray; Convolutional neural networks; COVID-19 disease; Ensemble classifier
"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are the digital form of patients’ medical reports or records. EHRs facilitate advanced analytics and aid in better decision-making for clinical data. Medical data are very complicated and using one classification algorithm to reach good results is difficult. For this reason, we use a combination of classification techniques to reach an efficient and accurate classification model. This model combination is called the Ensemble model. We need to predict new medical data with a high accuracy value in a small processing time. We propose a new ensemble model MDRL which is efficient with different datasets. The MDRL gives the highest accuracy value. It saves the processing time instead of processing four different algorithms sequentially; it executes the four algorithms in parallel. We implement five different algorithms on five variant datasets which are Heart Disease, Health General, Diabetes, Heart Attack, and Covid-19 Datasets. The four algorithms are Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP). In addition to MDRL (our proposed ensemble model) which includes MLP, DT, RF, and LR together. From our experiments, we conclude that our ensemble model has the best accuracy value for most datasets. We reach that the combination of the Correlation Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm and our ensemble model is the best for giving the highest accuracy value. The accuracy values for our ensemble model based on CFS are 98.86, 97.96, 100, 99.33, and 99.37 for heart disease, health general, Covid-19, heart attack, and diabetes datasets respectively. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

"The COVID-19 virus has spread rapidally throughout the world. Managing resources is one of the biggest challenges that healthcare providers around the world face during the pandemic. Allocating the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds' capacity is important since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and some patients need to be admitted to the hospital with an urgent need for oxygen support, ventilation, and/or intensive medical care. In the battle against COVID-19, many governments utilized technology, especially Artificial Intelligence (AI), to contain the pandemic and limit its hazardous effects. In this paper, Machine Learning models (ML) were developed to help in detecting the COVID-19 patients’ need for the ICU and the estimated duration of their stay. Four ML algorithms were utilized: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Ensemble models were trained and validated on a dataset of 895 COVID-19 patients admitted to King Fahad University hospital in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. The conducted experiments show that the Length of Stay (LoS) in the ICU can be predicted with the highest accuracy by applying the RF model for prediction, as the achieved accuracy was 94.16%. In terms of the contributor factors to the length of stay in the ICU, correlation results showed that age, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), nasal oxygen support days are the top related factors. By searching the literature, there is no published work that used the Saudi Arabia dataset to predict the need for ICU with the number of days needed. This contribution is hoped to pave the path for hospitals and healthcare providers to manage their resources more efficiently and to help in saving lives. © 2022 The Authors",Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Intensive care unit (ICU); Length of stay (LoS); Machine learning (ML); Predation; Resource management
"COVID-19 has caused havoc globally due to its transmission pace among the inhabitants and prolific rise in the number of people contracting the disease worldwide. As a result, the number of people seeking information about the epidemic via Internet media has increased. The impact of the hysteria that has prevailed makes people believe and share everything related to illness without questioning its truthfulness. As a result, it has amplified the misinformation spread on social media networks about the disease. Today, there is an immediate need to restrict disseminating false news, even more than ever before. This paper presents an early fusion-based method for combining key features extracted from context-based embeddings such as BERT, XLNet, and ELMo to enhance context and semantic information collection from social media posts and achieve higher accuracy for false news identification. From the observation, we found that the proposed early fusion-based method outperforms models that work on single embeddings. We also conducted detailed studies using several machine learning and deep learning models to classify misinformation on social media platforms relevant to COVID-19. To facilitate our work, we have utilized the dataset of “CONSTRAINT shared task 2021”. Our research has shown that language and ensemble models are well adapted to this role, with a 97% accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s).",Contextual embedding; COVID-19; Fake news; Machine learning; Social networks; Voting classifier
"Introduction: While the coronavirus only persists marginally for 95% of the infected cases, the remaining 5% are in critical or life-threatening conditions. This study aimed to design an intelligent model that predicts the severity level of the disease by modeling the relationships between the COVID-19 infection severity and the various demographic/clinical features of individuals. Materials and methods: A public dataset of a cross-sectional study including the demographic and symptomatological characteristics of 223 COVID-19 patients was used and randomly partitioned into training (75%) and testing (25%) datasets. During training, the class imbalance problem was solved, and the related factors with the COVID-19 severity were selected using the evolutionary method supported by a genetic algorithm. Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), QUEST algorithms together with confidence weighted voting, voting, and highest confidence wins strategies (HCWS) were constructed, and the predictive power of models was determined by performance metrics. Results: Based on the performance indicators, among the individual models, the NN model outperformed SVM and QUEST algorithms in the training and testing datasets. However, ensemble approaches gave better predictions as compared to individual models according to all the evaluation metrics. Conclusion: The proposed voting ensemble model outperforms other ensemble and individual machine learning approaches for the severity prediction of COVID-19 disease. The proposed ensemble learning model can be integrated into web or mobile applications to classify the severity of COVID-19 for clinical decision support. © 2022 A. CARBONE Editore.

"The rapid spread of the COVID-19 has not only affected personal health and economy, but also revolutionized people's lifestyles. As more people turn to work and socialize online, the development of unmanned technologies based on the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), such as unmanned delivery, unmanned vehicles, unmanned transportation, etc., will become an inevitable trend. However, all kinds of intelligent terminals for unmanned equipment require a large amount of data interaction with devices such as cloud servers, mobile terminals, and roadside terminals, which poses cyber security risks. Furthermore, the outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted people to put forward higher demands for the security of network communications. Unfortunately, the current intrusion detection methods based on machine learning still have weaknesses such as low accuracy and low efficiency when faced with unbalanced data distribution. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Tree-based BLS (TBLS) intrusion detection method according to the idea of ensemble learning and decision tree (CART and J48). The performance of TBLS was tested on the NSL-KDD dataset and the UNSW-NB15 dataset respectively, which contain a variety of malicious traffic types for attacks on the IoV. The results show that our proposed method can achieve higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate, compared with the existing 16 solutions.

"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. The modalities such as computed tomography (CT) have been successfully utilized for the early stage diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients. Recently, many researchers have utilized deep learning models for the automated screening of COVID-19 suspected cases. An ensemble deep learning and Internet of Things (IoT) based framework is proposed for screening of COVID-19 suspected cases. Three well-known pretrained deep learning models are ensembled. The medical IoT devices are utilized to collect the CT scans, and automated diagnoses are performed on IoT servers. The proposed framework is compared with thirteen competitive models over a four-class dataset. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ensembled deep learning model yielded 98.98% accuracy. Moreover, the model outperforms all competitive models in terms of other performance metrics achieving 98.56% precision, 98.58% recall, 98.75% F-score, and 98.57% AUC. Therefore, the proposed framework can improve the acceleration of COVID-19 diagnosis. © 2022 Anita S. Kini et al.",
"The spread of the COVID-19 disease has prompted a need for immediate reaction by governments to curb the pandemic. Many countries have adopted different policies and studies are performed to understand the effect of each of the policies on the growth rate of the infected cases. In this article, the data about the policies taken by all countries at each date, and the effect of the policies on the growth rate of the pandemic are used to build a model of the pandemic's behavior. The model takes as input a set of policies and predicts the growth rate of the pandemic. Then, a population-based multiobjective optimization algorithm is developed, which uses the model to search through the policy space and finds a set of policies that minimize the cost induced to the society due to the policies and the growth rate of the pandemic. Because of the complexity of the modeling problem and the uncertainty in measuring the growth rate of the pandemic via the models, an ensemble learning algorithm is proposed in this article to improve the performance of individual learning algorithms. The ensemble consists of ten learning algorithms and a metamodel algorithm that is built to predict the accuracy of each learning algorithm for a given data record. The metamodel is a set of support vector machine (SVM) algorithms that is used in the aggregation phase of the ensemble algorithm. Because there is uncertainty in measuring the growth rate via the models, a landscape smoothing operator is proposed in the optimization process, which aims at reducing uncertainty. The algorithm is tested on open access data online and experiments on the ensemble learning and the policy optimization algorithms are performed.

This research study aims to gauge the public's sentiment on working from home/ remotelocations during the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking their opinions on Twitter.

"Electricity demand forecast is necessary for power systems' operation scheduling and management. However, power consumption is uncertain and depends on several factors. Moreover, since the onset of covid-19, the electricity consumption pattern went through significant changes across the globe, which made the forecasting demand more challenging. This is mainly due to the fact that pandemic-driven restrictions changed people's lifestyles and work activities. This calls for new forecasting algorithms to more effectively handle these conditions. In this paper, ensemble-based machine learning models are utilized for this task. The lockdown temporal policies are added to the feature set in order to make the model capable of correcting itself in pandemic situations and enhance data quality for the forecasting task. Several ensemble-based machine learning models are examined for the short-term country-level demand prediction model. Besides, the quantile random forest regression is implemented for a probabilistic point of view. For case studies, the models are trained for predicting Germany's country-level demand. The results indicate that ensemble models, especially boosting and bagging-boosting models, are capable of accurate country-level demand forecast. Besides, the majority of these models are robust against missing the pandemic policy data. However, utilizing the pandemic policy data as features increases the forecasting accuracy during the pandemic situation significantly. Furthermore, the probabilistic quantile regression demonstrated high accuracy for the aforementioned case study. © 2013 IEEE.",COVID-19 pandemic; Decision tree ensembles; Demand forecasting; Machine learning; Probabilistic
"Corticosteroid has been proved to be one of the few effective treatments for COVID-19 patients. However, not all the patients were suitable for corticosteroid therapy. In this study, we aimed to propose a machine learning model to forecast the response to corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 patients. We retrospectively collected the clinical data about 666 COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroid therapy between January 27, 2020, and March 30, 2020, from two hospitals in China. The response to corticosteroid therapy was evaluated by hospitalization time, oxygen supply duration, and the outcomes of patients. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was applied for feature selection. Five prediction models were applied in the training cohort and assessed in an internal and an external validation dataset, respectively. Finally, two (C reactive protein, lymphocyte percent) of 36 candidate immune/inflammatory features were finally used for model development. All five models displayed promising predictive performance. Notably, the ensemble model, PRCTC (prediction of response to corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 patients), derived from three prediction models including Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), Neural Network (NN), and logistic regression (LR), achieved the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.810 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.760-0.861) in internal validation cohort and 0.845 (95% CI 0.779-0.911) in external validation cohort to predict patients' response to corticosteroid therapy. In conclusion, PRCTC proposed with universality and scalability is hopeful to provide tangible and prompt clinical decision support in management of COVID-19 patients and potentially extends to other medication predictions. © 2022.

"Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been endangering human health and life since 2019. The timely quarantine, diagnosis, and treatment of infected people are the most necessary and important work. The most widely used method of detecting COVID-19 is real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Along with RT-PCR, computed tomography (CT) has become a vital technique in diagnosing and managing COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 reveals a number of radiological signatures that can be easily recognized through chest CT. These signatures must be analyzed by radiologists. It is, however, an error-prone and time-consuming process. Deep Learning-based methods can be used to perform automatic chest CT analysis, which may shorten the analysis time. The aim of this study is to design a robust and rapid medical recognition system to identify positive cases in chest CT images using three Ensemble Learning-based models. There are several techniques in Deep Learning for developing a detection system. In this paper, we employed Transfer Learning. With this technique, we can apply the knowledge obtained from a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to a different but related task. In order to ensure the robustness of the proposed system for identifying positive cases in chest CT images, we used two Ensemble Learning methods namely Stacking and Weighted Average Ensemble (WAE) to combine the performances of three fine-tuned Base-Learners (VGG19, ResNet50, and DenseNet201). For Stacking, we explored 2-Levels and 3-Levels Stacking. The three generated Ensemble Learning-based models were trained on two chest CT datasets. A variety of common evaluation measures (accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score) are used to perform a comparative analysis of each method. The experimental results show that the WAE method provides the most reliable performance, achieving a high recall value which is a desirable outcome in medical applications as it poses a greater risk if a true infected patient is not identified. © 2022 by the authors.

"With COVID-19 affecting every country globally and changing everyday life, the ability to forecast the spread of the disease is more important than any previous epidemic. The conventional methods of disease-spread modeling, compartmental models, are based on the assumption of spatiotemporal homogeneity of the spread of the virus, which may cause forecasting to underperform, especially at high spatial resolutions. In this paper, we approach the forecasting task with an alternative technique—spatiotemporal machine learning. We present COVID-LSTM, a data-driven model based on a long short-term memory deep learning architecture for forecasting COVID-19 incidence at the county level in the USA. We use the weekly number of new positive cases as temporal input, and hand-engineered spatial features from Facebook movement and connectedness datasets to capture the spread of the disease in time and space. COVID-LSTM outperforms the COVID-19 Forecast Hub’s Ensemble model (COVIDhub-ensemble) on our 17-week evaluation period, making it the first model to be more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble over one or more forecast periods. Over the 4-week forecast horizon, our model is on average 50 cases per county more accurate than the COVIDhub-ensemble. We highlight that the underutilization of data-driven forecasting of disease spread prior to COVID-19 is likely due to the lack of sufficient data available for previous diseases, in addition to the recent advances in machine learning methods for spatiotemporal forecasting. We discuss the impediments to the wider uptake of data-driven forecasting, and whether it is likely that more deep learning-based models will be used in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",COVID-19; Geospatial artificial intelligence; LSTM; Spatiotemporal machine learning
"The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Along with the coronavirus pandemic, a new crisis has emerged, characterized by widespread fear and panic caused by a lack of information or, in some cases, outright fake messages. In these circumstances, Twitter is one of the most eminent and trusted social media platforms. Fake tweets, on the other hand, are challenging to detect and differentiate. The primary goal of this paper is to educate society about the importance of accurate information and prevent the spread of fake information. This paper has investigated COVID-19 fake data from various social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. The objective of this paper is to categorize given tweets as either fake or real news. The authors have tested various deep learning models on the COVID-19 fake dataset. Finally, the CT-BERT and RoBERTa deep learning models outperformed other deep learning models like BERT, BERTweet, AlBERT, and DistlBERT. The proposed ensemble deep learning architecture outperformed CT-BERT and RoBERTa on the COVID-19 fake news dataset using the multiplicative fusion technique. The proposed model’s performance in this technique was determined by the multiplicative product of the final predictive values of CT-BERT and RoBERTa. This technique overcomes the disadvantage of these CT-BERT and RoBERTa models’ incorrect predictive nature. The proposed architecture outperforms both well-known ML and DL models, with 98.88% accuracy and a 98.93% F1-score. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to EDP Sciences, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",
"It has been declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) the novel coronavirus a global pandemic due to an exponential spread in COVID-19 in the past months reaching over 100 million cases and resulting in approximately 3 million deaths worldwide. Amid this pandemic, identification of cyberbullying has become a more evolving area of research over posts or comments in social media platforms. In multilingual societies like India, code-switched texts comprise the majority of the Internet. Identifying the online bullying of the code-switched user is bit challenging than monolingual cases. As a first step towards enabling the development of approaches for cyberbullying detection, we developed a new code-switched dataset, collected from Twitter utterances annotated with binary labels. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed dataset, we build different machine learning (Support Vector Machine & Logistic Regression) and deep learning (Multilayer Perceptron, Convolution Neural Network, BiLSTM, BERT) algorithms to detect cyberbullying of English-Hindi (En-Hi) code-switched text. Our proposed model integrates different hand-crafted features and is enriched by sequential and semantic patterns generated by different state-of-the-art deep neural network models. Initial experimental results of the proposed deep ensemble model on our code-switched data reveal that our approach yields state-of-the-art results, i.e., 0.93 in terms of macro-averaged F1 score.

"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread all over the world. It is found that the low sensitivity of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) examinations during the early stage of COVID-19 disease. Thus, efficient models are desirable for early-stage testing of COVID-19 infected patients. Chest X-ray (CXR) images of COVID-19 infected patients have shown some bilateral changes. In this paper, deep transfer learning and a deep forest-based model are proposed to diagnose COVID-19 infection from CXR images. Initially, features of X-ray images are extracted using the well-known deep transfer learning model (i.e., ResNet101), which does not require tuning many parameters compared to the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). After that, the deep forest model is utilised to predict COVID-19 infected patients. The deep forest is based upon ensemble learning and requires a small number of hyper-parameters. Additionally, the proposed model is trained on a multi-class dataset that contains four different classes as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia, tuberculosis, and healthy patients. The comparisons are drawn among the proposed deep transfer learning and deep forest-based models, the competitive models. The obtained results show that the proposed model effectively diagnoses COVID-19 infection with an accuracy of 99.4%. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",CNN; COVID-19; deep forest; deep learning; ResNet101; testing
"Reliable modeling of novel commutative cases of COVID-19 (CCC) is essential for determining hospitalization needs and providing the benchmark for health-related policies. The current study proposes multi-regional modeling of CCC cases for the first scenario using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) based on automatic routines (AUTOARIMA), ARIMA with maximum likelihood (ARIMAML), and ARIMA with generalized least squares method (ARI-MAGLS) and ensembled (ARIMAML-ARIMAGLS). Subsequently, different deep learning (DL) models viz: long short-term memory (LSTM), random forest (RF), and ensemble learning (EML) were applied to the second scenario to predict the effect of forest knowledge (FK) during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this purpose, augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) and Phillips–Perron (PP) unit root tests, autocorrelation function (ACF), partial autocorrelation function (PACF), Schwarz information criterion (SIC), and residual diagnostics were considered in determining the best ARIMA model for cumulative COVID-19 cases (CCC) across multi-region countries. Seven different performance criteria were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The obtained results justified both types of ARIMA model, with ARIMAGLS and ensemble ARIMA demonstrating superiority to the other models. Among the DL models analyzed, LSTM-M1 emerged as the best and most reliable estimation model, with both RF and LSTM attaining more than 80% prediction accuracy. While the EML of the DL proved merit with 96% accuracy. The outcomes of the two scenarios indicate the superiority of ARIMA time series and DL models in further decision making for FK. © 2022 by the authors.

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and medicinal resources have become inadequate in several regions. Computed tomography (CT) scans are capable of achieving precise and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis compared to the RT-PCR test. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), find it useful to design COVID-19 diagnoses using chest CT scans. In this aspect, this study concentrates on the design of an artificial intelligence-based ensemble model for the detection and classification (AIEM-DC) of COVID-19. The AIEM-DC technique aims to accurately detect and classify the COVID-19 using an ensemble of DL models. In addition, Gaussian filtering (GF)-based preprocessing technique is applied for the removal of noise and improve image quality. Moreover, a shark optimization algorithm (SOA) with an ensemble of DL models, namely recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU), is employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, an improved bat algorithm with a multiclass support vector machine (IBA-MSVM) model is applied for the classification of CT scans. The design of the ensemble model with optimal parameter tuning of the MSVM model for COVID-19 classification shows the novelty of the work. The effectiveness of the AIEM-DC technique take place on benchmark CT image data set, and the results reported the promising classification performance of the AIEM-DC technique over the recent state-of-the-art approaches. © 2021 by the authors.

"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing a face mask is one of the most effective protections from airborne infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Since the spread of COVID-19, infected countries have been enforcing strict mask regulation for indoor businesses and public spaces. While wearing a mask is a requirement, the position and type of the mask should also be considered in order to increase the effectiveness of face masks, especially at specific public locations. However, this makes it difficult for conventional facial recognition technology to identify individuals for security checks. To solve this problem, the Spartan Face Detection and Facial Recognition System with stacking ensemble deep learning algorithms is proposed to cover four major issues: Mask Detection, Mask Type Classification, Mask Position Classification and Identity Recognition. CNN, AlexNet, VGG16, and Facial Recognition Pipeline with FaceNet are the Deep Learning algorithms used to classify the features in each scenario. This system is powered by five components including training platform, server, supporting frameworks, hardware, and user interface. Complete unit tests, use cases, and results analytics are used to evaluate and monitor the performance of the system.

"COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than 144 million people and spread to over 200 countries. The prediction of COVID-19 behaviour and trend is crucial to prevent its spreading. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is Asia’s fifth largest country, and it hosts the two holiest cities of the Islamic world. KSA hosts millions of pilgrims every year, and it is of great importance to predict the COV-ID-19 spread to organize these religious activities and bring life to normality in KSA. This study proposes four tree-based ensemble methods to predict the COV-ID-19 daily new cases in KSA. Tree-based ensemble methods are suggested to reduce the variance and/or bias of inconsistent models. The four models utilized in the study are Gradient Tree Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Voting Regressor (VR). The study is conducted using “Our Data in World” (OWID) COVID-19 dataset from the first confirmed case in KSA, i.e., 2nd March 2020 to 14th April 2021. The results suggest that the tree-based ensemble models provide a good prediction of daily COVID-19 new cases and can follow the trend of COVID-19. Among the models, XGBoost and VR performed better than the other three models with the best evaluation metric scores (MAE:4.41, RMSE:7.11, MAPE:0.95%).

"COVID-19 is a growing problem worldwide with a high mortality rate. As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic. In order to limit the spread of the disease, a fast and accurate diagnosis is required. A reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is often used to detect the disease. However, since this test is time-consuming, a chest computed tomography (CT) or plain chest X-ray (CXR) is sometimes indicated. The value of automated diagnosis is that it saves time and money by minimizing human effort. Three significant contributions are made by our research. Its initial purpose is to use the essential finetuning methodology to test the action and efficiency of a variety of vision models, ranging from Inception to Neural Architecture Search (NAS) networks. Second, by plotting class activation maps (CAMs) for individual networks and assessing classification efficiency with AUC-ROC curves, the behavior of these models is visually analyzed. Finally, stacked ensembles techniques were used to provide greater generalization by combining finetuned models with six ensemble neural networks. Using stacked ensembles, the generalization of the models improved. Furthermore, the ensemble model created by combining all of the finetuned networks obtained a state-of-the-art COVID-19 accuracy detection score of 99.17%. The precision and recall rates were 99.99% and 89.79%, respectively, highlighting the robustness of stacked ensembles.

"The year 2020 will certainly be remembered for the COVID-19 outbreak. First reported in Wuhan city of China back in December 2019, the number of people getting affected by this contagious virus has grown exponentially. Given the population density of India, the implementation of the mantra of the test, track, and isolate is not obtaining satisfactory results. A shortage of testing kits and an increasing number of fresh cases encouraged us to come up with a model that can aid radiologists in detecting COVID19 using chest Xray images. In the proposed framework the low level features from the Chest X-ray images are extracted using an ensemble of four pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures, namely VGGNet, GoogleNet, DenseNet, and NASNet and later on are fed to a fully connected layer for classification. The proposed multi model ensemble architecture is validated on two publicly available datasets and one private dataset. We have shown that our multi model ensemble architecture performs better than single classifier.

"One of the promising methods for early detection of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) among symptomatic patients is to analyze chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans or chest x-rays images of individuals using Deep Learning (DL) techniques. This paper proposes a novel stacked ensemble to detect COVID-19 either from chest CT scans or chest x-ray images of an individual. The proposed model is a stacked ensemble of heterogenous pre-trained computer vision models. Four pre-trained DL models were considered: Visual Geometry Group (VGG 19), Residual Network (ResNet 101), Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet 169) and Wide Residual Network (WideResNet 50 2). From each pre-trained model, the potential candidates for base classifiers were obtained by varying the number of additional fully-connected layers. After an exhaustive search, three best-performing diverse models were selected to design a weighted average-based heterogeneous stacked ensemble. Five different chest CT scans and chest x-ray images were used to train and evaluate the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model was compared with two other ensemble models, baseline pre-trained computer vision models and existing models for COVID-19 detection. The proposed model achieved uniformly good performance on five different datasets, consisting of chest CT scans and chest x-rays images. In relevance to COVID-19, as the recall is more important than precision, the trade-offs between recall and precision at different thresholds were explored. Recommended threshold values which yielded a high recall and accuracy were obtained for each dataset. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has brought huge losses to the world, and it remains a great threat to public health. X-ray computed tomography (CT) plays a central role in the management of COVID-19. Traditional diagnosis with pulmonary CT images is time-consuming and error-prone, which could not meet the need for precise and rapid COVID-19 screening. Nowadays, deep learning (DL) has been successfully applied to CT image analysis, which assists radiologists in workflow scheduling and treatment planning for patients with COVID-19. Traditional methods use cross-entropy as the loss function with a Softmax classifier following a fully-connected layer. Most DL-based classification methods target intraclass relationships in a certain class (early, progressive, severe, or dissipative phases), ignoring the natural order of different phases of the disease progression, i.e., from an early stage and progress to a late stage. To learn both intraclass and interclass relationships among different stages and improve the accuracy of classification, this paper proposes an ensemble learning method based on ordinal regression, which leverages the ordinal information on COVID-19 phases. The proposed method uses multi-binary, neuron stick-breaking (NSB), and soft labels (SL) techniques, and ensembles the ordinal outputs through a median selection. To evaluate our method, we collected 172 confirmed cases. In a 2-fold cross-validation experiment, the accuracy is increased by 22% compared with traditional methods when we use modified ResNet-18 as the backbone. And precision, recall, and F1-score are also improved. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a better classification performance than the traditional methods, which helps establish guidelines for the classification of COVID-19 chest CT images. © 2021 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",
"Social media platforms generate an enormous amount of data every day. Millions of users engage themselves with the posts circulated on these platforms. Despite the social regulations and protocols imposed by these platforms, it is difficult to restrict some objectionable posts carrying hateful content. Automatic hate speech detection on social media platforms is an essential task that has not been solved efficiently despite multiple attempts by various researchers. It is a challenging task that involves identifying hateful content from social media posts. These posts may reveal hate outrageously, or they may be subjective to the user or a community. Relying on manual inspection delays the process, and the hateful content may remain available online for a long time. The current state-of-the-art methods for tackling hate speech perform well when tested on the same dataset but fail miserably on cross-datasets. Therefore, we propose an ensemble learning-based adaptive model for automatic hate speech detection, improving the cross-dataset generalization. The proposed expert model for hate speech detection works towards overcoming the strong user-bias present in the available annotated datasets. We conduct our experiments under various experimental setups and demonstrate the proposed model's efficacy on the latest issues such as COVID-19 and US presidential elections. In particular, the loss in performance observed under cross-dataset evaluation is the least among all the models. Also, while restricting the maximum number of tweets per user, we incur no drop in performance. © 2021",Ensemble learning; Hate speech detection; Social media
"Pneumonia is a severe infection that affects the lungs due to viral or bacterial infections such as the novel COVID-19 virus resulting in mild to critical health conditions. One way to diagnose pneumonia is to screen prospective patient’s lungs using either a Computed Tomography (CT) scan or chest X-ray. To help radiologists in processing a large amount of data especially during pandemics, and to overcome some limitations in deep learning approaches, this paper introduces a new approach that utilizes a few light-weighted densely connected bottleneck residual block features to extract rich spatial information. Then, shrinking data batches into a single vector using four efficient methods. Next, an adaptive weight setup is proposed utilizing Adaboost ensemble learning which adaptively sets weight for each classifier depending on the scores generated to achieve the highest true positive rates while maintaining low negative rates.

The unexpected outbreak and unrealistic progression of COVID-19 have generated an utmost need to realize promising therapeutic strategies to fight the pandemic. Drug repurposing-an efficient drug discovery technique from approved drugs is an emerging tactic to face the immediate global challenge. It? offers a time-efficient and cost-effective way to find potential therapeutic agents for the disease. Artificial Intelligence-empowered deep learning models enable the rapid identification of potentially repurposable drug candidates against diseases. This study presents a deep learning ensemble model to prioritize clinically validated anti-viral drugs for their potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The method integrates the similarities of drug chemical structures and virus genome sequences to generate feature vectors. The best combination of features is retrieved by the convolutional neural network in a deep learning manner. The extracted deep features are classified by the extreme gradient boosting classifier to infer potential virus–drug associations. The method could achieve an AUC of 0.8897 with 0.8571 prediction accuracy and 0.8394 sensitivity under the fivefold cross-validation. The experimental results and case studies demonstrate the suggested deep learning ensemble system yields competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The top-ranked drugs are released for further wet-lab researches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Antiviral drugs; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19 drug repurposing; Deep learning; SARS-coV-2; XGBoost
"Prediction of complex epidemiological systems such as COVID-19 is challenging on many grounds. Commonly used compartmental models struggle to handle an epidemiological process that evolves rapidly and is spatially heterogeneous. On the other hand, machine learning methods are limited at the beginning of the pandemics due to small data size for training. We propose a deep learning approach to predict future COVID-19 infection cases and deaths 1 to 4 weeks ahead at the fine granularity of US counties. The multi-variate Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained on multiple time series samples at the same time, including a mobility series. Results show that adding mobility as a variable and using multiple samples to train the network improve predictive performance both in terms of bias and of variance of the forecasts. We also show that the predicted results have similar accuracy and spatial patterns with a standard ensemble model used as benchmark. The model is attractive in many respects, including the fine geographic granularity of predictions and great predictive performance several weeks ahead. Furthermore, data requirement and computational intensity are reduced by substituting a single model to multiple models folded in an ensemble model. © 2021, The Author(s).",
"The Coronavirus has spread across the world and infected millions of people, causing devastating damage to the public health and global economies. To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus a reliable, fast, and accurate diagnostic system should be promptly implemented. In this study, we propose EpistoNet, a decision tree-based ensemble model using two mixtures of discriminative experts to classify COVID-19 lung infection from chest X-ray images. To optimize the architecture and hyper-parameters of the designed neural networks, we employed Epistocracy algorithm, a recently proposed hyper-heuristic evolutionary method. Using 2500 chest X-ray images consisting of 1250 COVID-19 and 1250 non-COVID-19 cases, we left out 500 images for testing and partitioned the remaining 2000 images into 5 different clusters using K-means clustering algorithm. We trained multiple deep convolutional neural networks on each cluster to help build a mixture of strong discriminative experts from the top-performing models supervised by a gating network. The final ensemble model obtained 95% accuracy on COVID-19 images and 93% accuracy on non-COVID-19. The experimental results show that EpistoNet can accurately, and reliably be used to detect COVID-19 infection in the chest X-ray images, and Epistocracy algorithm can be effectively used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the proposed models. © 2021, The Author(s).",
"The COVID-19 epidemic has had a great adverse impact on the world, having taken a heavy toll, killing hundreds of thousands of people. In order to help the world better combat COVID-19 and reduce its death toll, this study focuses on the COVID-19 mortality. First, using the multiple stepwise regression analysis method, the factors from eight aspects (economy, society, climate etc.) that may affect the mortality rates of COVID-19 in various countries is examined. In addition, a two-layer nested heterogeneous ensemble learning-based prediction method that combines linear regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme learning machine (ELM) is developed to predict the development trends of COVID-19 mortality in various countries. Based on data from 79 countries, the experiment proves that age structure (proportion of the population over 70 years old) and medical resources (number of beds) are the main factors affecting the mortality of COVID-19 in each country. In addition, it is found that the number of nucleic acid tests and climatic factors are correlated with COVID-19 mortality. At the same time, when predicting COVID-19 mortality, the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning-based prediction method shows better prediction ability than state-of-the-art machine learning methods such as LR, SVM, ELM, random forest (RF), long short-term memory (LSTM) etc. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Ensemble learning; Hybrid method; Mortality; Stepwise multiple regression; Time series prediction
"Under the present circumstances, when we are still under the threat of different strains of coronavirus, and since the most widely used method for COVID-19 detection, RT-PCR is a tedious and time-consuming manual procedure with poor precision, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is inevitable. Though, some vaccines have now been authorized worldwide, it will take huge time to reach everyone, especially in developing countries. In this work, we have analyzed Chest X-ray (CXR) images for the detection of the coronavirus. The primary agenda of this proposed research study is to leverage the classification performance of the deep learning models using ensemble learning. Many papers have proposed different ensemble learning techniques in this field, some methods using aggregation functions like Weighted Arithmetic Mean (WAM) among others. However, none of these methods take into consideration the decisions that subsets of the classifiers take. In this paper, we have applied Choquet integral for ensemble and propose a novel method for the evaluation of fuzzy measures using coalition game theory, information theory, and Lambda fuzzy approximation. Three different sets of fuzzy measures are calculated using three different weighting schemes along with information theory and coalition game theory. Using these three sets of fuzzy measures, three Choquet integrals are calculated and their decisions are finally combined. Besides, we have created a database by combining several image repositories developed recently. Impressive results on the newly developed dataset and the challenging COVIDx dataset support the efficacy and robustness of the proposed method. Our experimental results outperform many recently proposed methods. © 2013 IEEE.",Chest X-Ray Images; Choquet Integral; Coalition Game; COVID-19; Deep Learning; Information Theory; Lambda Fuzzy
"To inform data-driven decisions in fighting the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, this research develops a spatiotemporal analysis framework under the combination of an ensemble model (random forest regression) and a multi-objective optimization algorithm (NSGA-II). It has been verified for four Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea, Pakistan, and Nepal. Accordingly, we can gain some valuable experience to better understand the disease evolution, forecast the prevalence of the disease, which can provide sustainable evidence to guide further intervention and management. Random forest with a proper rolling time-window can learn the combined effects of environmental and social factors to accurately predict the daily growth of confirmed cases and daily death rate on a national scale, which is followed by NSGA-II to find a range of Pareto optimal solutions for ensuring the minimization of the infection rate and mortality at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate that the predictive model can alert the local government in advance, allowing the accused time to put forward relevant measures. The temperature in the category of environment and the stringency index belonging to the social factor are identified as the top 2 important features to exert a greater impact on the virus transmission. Moreover, optimal solutions provide references to design the best control strategies towards pandemic containment and prevention that can accommodate the country-specific circumstance, which are possible to decrease the two objectives by more than 95%. In particular, appropriate adjustment of social-related features needs to take priority over others, since it can bring about at least 1.47% average improvement of two objectives compared to environmental factors. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Feature importance analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Random forest regression; Sustainability
"This work develops a robust classifier for a COVID-19 pre-screening model from crowdsourced cough sound data. The crowdsourced cough recordings contain a variable number of coughs, with some input sound files more informative than the others. Accurate detection of COVID-19 from the sound datasets requires overcoming two main challenges (i) the variable number of coughs in each recording and (ii) the low number of COVID-positive cases compared to healthy coughs in the data. We use two open datasets of crowdsourced cough recordings and segment each cough recording into non-overlapping coughs. The segmentation enriches the original data without oversampling by splitting the original cough sound files into non-overlapping segments. Splitting the sound files enables us to increase the samples of the minority class (COVID-19) without changing the feature distribution of the COVID-19 samples resulted from applying oversampling techniques. Each cough sound segment is transformed into six image representations for further analyses. We conduct extensive experiments with shallow machine learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and pre-trained CNN models. The results of our models were compared to other recently published papers that apply machine learning to cough sound data for COVID-19 detection. Our method demonstrated a high performance using an ensemble model on the testing dataset with area under receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.77, precision = 0.80, recall = 0.71, F1 measure = 0.75, and Kappa = 0.53. The results show an improvement in the prediction accuracy of our COVID-19 pre-screening model compared to the other models. © 2021, The Author(s).",
"With the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases, medical practitioners are searching for accurate and quick automated detection methods to prevent Covid from spreading while trying to reduce the computational requirement of devices. In this research article, a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based accurate and efficient ensemble model using deep learning is being proposed with 2161 COVID-19, 2022 pneumonia, and 5863 normal chest X-ray images that has been collected from previous publications and other online resources. To improve the detection accuracy contrast enhancement and image normalization have been done to produce better quality images at the pre-processing level. Further data augmentation methods are used by creating modified versions of images in the dataset to train the four efficient CNN models (Inceptionv3, DenseNet121, Xception, InceptionResNetv2) Experimental results provide 98.33% accuracy for binary class and 92.36% for multiclass.

"COVID-19 has crippled the world’s healthcare systems, setting back the economy and taking the lives of several people. Although potential vaccines are being tested and supplied around the world, it will take a long time to reach every human being, more so with new variants of the virus emerging, enforcing a lockdown-like situation on parts of the world. Thus, there is a dire need for early and accurate detection of COVID-19 to prevent the spread of the disease, even more. The current gold-standard RT-PCR test is only 71% sensitive and is a laborious test to perform, leading to the incapability of conducting the population-wide screening. To this end, in this paper, we propose an automated COVID-19 detection system that uses CT-scan images of the lungs for classifying the same into COVID and Non-COVID cases. The proposed method applies an ensemble strategy that generates fuzzy ranks of the base classification models using the Gompertz function and fuses the decision scores of the base models adaptively to make the final predictions on the test cases. Three transfer learning-based convolutional neural network models are used, namely VGG-11, Wide ResNet-50-2, and Inception v3, to generate the decision scores to be fused by the proposed ensemble model. The framework has been evaluated on two publicly available chest CT scan datasets achieving state-of-the-art performance, justifying the reliability of the model.

"Infectious diseases are highly contagious due to rapid transmission and very challenging to diagnose in the early stage. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning now become a strategic weapon in assisting infectious disease prevention, rapid-response in diagnosis, surveillance, and management. In this paper, a bifold COVID_SCREENET architecture is introduced for providing COVID-19 screening solutions using Chest Radiography (CR) images. Transfer learning using nine pre-trained ImageNet models to extract the features of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images is adapted in the first fold and classified using baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A Modified Stacked Ensemble Learning (MSEL) is proposed in the second fold by stacking the top five pre-trained models, and then the predictions resulted. Experimentation is carried out in two folds: In first fold, open-source samples are considered and in second fold 2216 real-time samples collected from Tamilnadu Government Hospitals, India, and the screening results for COVID data is 100% accurate in both the cases. The proposed approach is also validated and blind reviewed with the help of two radiologists at Thanjavur Medical College & Hospitals by collecting 2216 chest X-ray images between the month of April and May. Based on the reports, the measures are calculated for COVID_SCREENET and it showed 100% accuracy in performing multi-class classification. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",AI diagnostics tool; COVID-19; Deep learning; Diagnostic radiography; Machine learning; Medical diagnosis; X-rays
"Background: Immune and inflammatory dysfunction was reported to underpin critical COVID-19(coronavirus disease 2019). We aim to develop a machine learning model that enables accurate prediction of critical COVID-19 using immune-inflammatory features at admission. Methods: We retrospectively collected 2076 consecutive COVID-19 patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death) between January 27, 2020 and March 30, 2020 from two hospitals in China. Critical illness was defined as admission to intensive care unit, receiving invasive ventilation, or death. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) was applied for feature selection. Five machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Neural Network (NN) were built in a training dataset, and assessed in an internal validation dataset and an external validation dataset. Results: Six features (procalcitonin, [T + B + NK cell] count, interleukin 6, C reactive protein, interleukin 2 receptor, T-helper lymphocyte/T-suppressor lymphocyte) were finally used for model development. Five models displayed varying but all promising predictive performance. Notably, the ensemble model, SPMCIIP (severity prediction model for COVID-19 by immune-inflammatory parameters), derived from three contributive algorithms (SVM, GBDT, and NN) achieved the best performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.991 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.979–1.000) in internal validation cohort and 0.999 (95% CI 0.998–1.000) in external validation cohort to identify patients with critical COVID-19. SPMCIIP could accurately and expeditiously predict the occurrence of critical COVID-19 approximately 20 days in advance. Conclusions: The developed online prediction model SPMCIIP is hopeful to facilitate intensive monitoring and early intervention of high risk of critical illness in COVID-19 patients.

"Background: Ensemble modeling aims to boost the forecasting performance by systematically integrating the predictive accuracy across individual models. Here we introduce a simple-yet-powerful ensemble methodology for forecasting the trajectory of dynamic growth processes that are defined by a system of non-linear differential equations with applications to infectious disease spread. Methods: We propose and assess the performance of two ensemble modeling schemes with different parametric bootstrapping procedures for trajectory forecasting and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, we conduct sequential probabilistic forecasts to evaluate their forecasting performance using simple dynamical growth models with good track records including the Richards model, the generalized-logistic growth model, and the Gompertz model. We first test and verify the functionality of the method using simulated data from phenomenological models and a mechanistic transmission model. Next, the performance of the method is demonstrated using a diversity of epidemic datasets including scenario outbreak data of the Ebola Forecasting Challenge and real-world epidemic data outbreaks of including influenza, plague, Zika, and COVID-19. Results: We found that the ensemble method that randomly selects a model from the set of individual models for each time point of the trajectory of the epidemic frequently outcompeted the individual models as well as an alternative ensemble method based on the weighted combination of the individual models and yields broader and more realistic uncertainty bounds for the trajectory envelope, achieving not only better coverage rate of the 95% prediction interval but also improved mean interval scores across a diversity of epidemic datasets. Conclusion: Our new methodology for ensemble forecasting outcompete component models and an alternative ensemble model that differ in how the variance is evaluated for the generation of the prediction intervals of the forecasts. © 2021, The Author(s).","Differential equations; Generalized logistic growth model; Gompertz model; Interval score; Model ensemble, parameter estimation, uncertainty quantification, phenomenological growth; Parametric bootstrapping; Richards model"
"Accurate prediction of immunogenic peptide recognized by T cell receptor (TCR) can greatly benefit vaccine development and cancer immunotherapy. However, identifying immunogenic peptides accurately is still a huge challenge. Most of the antigen peptides predicted in silico fail to elicit immune responses in vivo without considering TCR as a key factor. This inevitably causes costly and time-consuming experimental validation test for predicted antigens. Therefore, it is necessary to develop novel computational methods for precisely and effectively predicting immunogenic peptide recognized by TCR. Here, we described DLpTCR, a multimodal ensemble deep learning framework for predicting the likelihood of interaction between single/paired chain(s) of TCR and peptide presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules. To investigate the generality and robustness of the proposed model, COVID-19 data and IEDB data were constructed for independent evaluation. The DLpTCR model exhibited high predictive power with area under the curve up to?0.91 on COVID-19 data while predicting the interaction between peptide and single TCR chain. Additionally, the DLpTCR model achieved the overall accuracy of 81.03% on IEDB data while predicting the interaction between peptide and paired TCR chains. The results demonstrate that DLpTCR has the ability to learn general interaction rules and generalize to antigen peptide recognition by TCR.

"The remarkable flexibility and adaptability of both deep learning models and ensemble methods have led to the proliferation for their application in understanding many physical phenomena. Traditionally, these two techniques have largely been treated as independent methodologies in practical applications. This study develops an optimized ensemble deep learning framework wherein these two machine learning techniques are jointly used to achieve synergistic improvements in model accuracy, stability, scalability, and reproducibility, prompting a new wave of applications in the forecasting of dynamics. Unpredictability is considered one of the key features of chaotic dynamics; therefore, forecasting such dynamics of nonlinear systems is a relevant issue in the scientific community. It becomes more challenging when the prediction of extreme events is the focus issue for us. In this circumstance, the proposed optimized ensemble deep learning (OEDL) model based on a best convex combination of feed-forward neural networks, reservoir computing, and long short-term memory can play a key role in advancing predictions of dynamics consisting of extreme events. The combined framework can generate the best out-of-sample performance than the individual deep learners and standard ensemble framework for both numerically simulated and real-world data sets. We exhibit the outstanding performance of the OEDL framework for forecasting extreme events generated from a Liénard-type system, prediction of COVID-19 cases in Brazil, dengue cases in San Juan, and sea surface temperature in the Niño 3.4 region. © 2021 Author(s).",
"The current population worldwide extensively uses social media to share thoughts, societal issues, and personal concerns. Social media can be viewed as an intelligent platform that can be augmented with a capability to analyze and predict various issues such as business needs, environmental needs, election trends (polls), governmental needs, etc. This has motivated us to initiate a comprehensive search of the COVID-19 pandemic-related views and opinions amongst the population on Twitter. The basic training data have been collected from Twitter posts. On this basis, we have developed research involving ensemble deep learning techniques to reach a better prediction of the future evolutions of views in Twitter when compared to previous works that do the same. First, feature extraction is performed through an N-gram stacked autoencoder supervised learning algorithm. The extracted features are then involved in a classification and prediction involving an ensemble fusion scheme of selected ma-chine learning techniques such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). all individual results are combined/fused for a better prediction by using both mean and mode techniques. Our proposed scheme of an N-gram stacked encoder integrated in an ensemble machine learning scheme outperforms all the other existing competing techniques such unigram autoencoder, bigram autoencoder, etc. Our experimental results have been obtained from a comprehensive evaluation involving a dataset extracted from open-source data available from Twitter that were filtered by using the keywords “covid”, “covid19”, “coronavirus”, “covid-19”, “sarscov2”, and “covid_19”. © 2021 by the author.

"Background: To classify chest computed tomography (CT) images as positive or negative for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) quickly and accurately, researchers attempted to develop effective models by using medical images. Results: A convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble model was developed for classifying chest CT images as positive or negative for COVID-19. To classify chest CT images acquired from COVID-19 patients, the proposed COVID19-CNN ensemble model combines the use of multiple trained CNN models with a majority voting strategy. The CNN models were trained to classify chest CT images by transfer learning from well-known pre-trained CNN models and by applying their algorithm hyperparameters as appropriate. The combination of algorithm hyperparameters for a pre-trained CNN model was determined by uniform experimental design. The chest CT images (405 from COVID-19 patients and 397 from healthy patients) used for training and performance testing of the COVID19-CNN ensemble model were obtained from an earlier study by Hu in 2020. Experiments showed that, the COVID19-CNN ensemble model achieved 96.7% accuracy in classifying CT images as COVID-19 positive or negative, which was superior to the accuracies obtained by the individual trained CNN models. Other performance measures (i.e., precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score) obtained bythe COVID19-CNN ensemble model were higher than those obtained by individual trained CNN models. Conclusions: The COVID19-CNN ensemble model had superior accuracy and excellent capability in classifying chest CT images as COVID-19 positive or negative. © 2021, The Author(s).",Algorithm hyperparameter; Chest computed tomography image; Convolutional neural network; COVID-19; Ensemble model
"The primary factor that contributes to the transmission of COVID-19 infection is human mobility. Positive instances added on a daily basis have a substantial positive association with the pace of human mobility, and the reverse is true. Thus, having the ability to predict human mobility trend during a pandemic is critical for policymakers to help in decreasing the rate of transmission in the future. In this regard, one approach that is commonly used for time-series data prediction is to build an ensemble with the aim of getting the best performance. However, building an ensemble often causes the performance of the model to decrease, due to the increasing number of parameters that are not being optimized properly. Consequently, the purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a deep learning ensemble model, which is optimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) that incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM). A CNN is used to conduct feature extraction from mobility time-series data, while an LSTM is used to do mobility prediction. The parameters of both layers are adjusted using GA. As a result of the experiments conducted with data from the Google Community Mobility Reports in Indonesia that ranges from the beginning of February 2020 to the end of December 2020, the GA-Optimized Multivariate CNN-LSTM ensemble outperforms stand-alone CNN and LSTM models, as well as the non-optimized CNN-LSTM model, in terms of predicting human movement in the future. This may be useful in assisting policymakers in anticipating future human mobility trends. © 2021 by the authors.

"Asymptomatic COVID-19 has become one of the biggest challenges for controlling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2. Diagnosis of asymptomatic COVID-19 mainly depends on quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), which is typically time-consuming and requires expensive reagents. The application is limited in countries that lack sufficient resources to handle large-scale assay during the COVID-19 outbreak. Here, we demonstrated a new approach to detect the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection using serum metabolic patterns combined with ensemble learning. The direct patterns of metabolites and lipids were extracted by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) within 1 s with simple sample preparation. A new ensemble learning model was developed using stacking strategy with a new voting algorithm. This approach was validated in a large cohort of 274 samples (92 asymptomatic COVID-19 and 182 healthy control), and provided the high accuracy of 93.4%, with only 5% false negative and 7% false positive rates. We also identified a biomarker panel of ten metabolites and lipids, as well as the altered metabolic pathways during asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection.

"Asymptomatic infection is a big challenge in curbing the spread of COVID-19. However, its identification and pathogenesis elucidation remain issues.

"The water supply in megacities can be affected by the living habits and population mobility, so the fluctuation degree of daily water supply data is acute, which presents a great challenge to the water demand prediction. This is because that non-stationarity of daily data can have a large influence on the generalization ability of models. In this study, the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) and wavelet transform (WT) methods were used to carry out decomposition of daily data to solve the non-stationarity problem. The bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM), seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and Gaussian radial basis function neural network (GRBFNN) were developed to carry out prediction of different subseries. The ensemble learning was introduced to improve the generalization ability of models, and prediction interval was generated based on student's t-test to cope with the variation of water supply laws. This study method was applied to the daily water demand prediction in Shenzhen and cross-validation was performed. The results show that WT is superior to HP decomposition method, but maximum decomposition level of WT should not be set too high, otherwise the trend characteristics of subseries will be weakened. Although the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused a variation in water supply laws, this variation is still within the prediction interval. The WT and coupling models accurately predict water demand and provide the optimal mean square error (0.17%), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (97.21%), mean relative error (0.1), mean absolute error (3.32%), and correlation coefficient (0.99). © 2021, The Author(s).",BLSTM; GRBFNN; Prediction interval; SARIMA; Water demand prediction; Wavelet transform
"Background: Time-series forecasting has a critical role during pandemics as it provides essential information that can lead to abstaining from the spread of the disease. The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, is spreading rapidly all over the world. The countries with dense populations, in particular, such as India, await imminent risk in tackling the epidemic. Different forecasting models are being used to predict future cases of COVID-19. The predicament for most of them is that they are not able to capture both the linear and nonlinear features of the data solely. Methods: We propose an ensemble model integrating an autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NAR). ARIMA models are used to extract the linear correlations and the NAR neural network for modeling the residuals of ARIMA containing nonlinear components of the data. Comparison: Single ARIMA model, ARIMA-NAR model and few other existing models which have been applied on the COVID-19 data in different countries are compared based on performance evaluation parameters. Result: The hybrid combination displayed significant reduction in RMSE (16.23%), MAE (37.89%) and MAPE (39.53%) values when compared with single ARIMA model for daily observed cases. Similar results with reduced error percentages were found for daily reported deaths and cases of recovery as well. RMSE value of our hybrid model was lesser in comparison to other models used for forecasting COVID-19 in different countries. Conclusion: Results suggested the effectiveness of the new hybrid model over a single ARIMA model in capturing the linear as well as nonlinear patterns of the COVID-19 data. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",ARIMA; COVID-19; Forecasting; Hybrid model; NAR
"Effective screening of COVID-19 cases has been becoming extremely important to mitigate and stop the quick spread of the disease during the current period of COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. In this article, we consider radiology examination of using chest X-ray images, which is among the effective screening approaches for COVID-19 case detection. Given deep learning is an effective tool and framework for image analysis, there have been lots of studies for COVID-19 case detection by training deep learning models with X-ray images. Although some of them report good prediction results, their proposed deep learning models might suffer from overfitting, high variance, and generalization errors caused by noise and a limited number of datasets. Considering ensemble learning can overcome the shortcomings of deep learning by making predictions with multiple models instead of a single model, we propose EDL-COVID, an ensemble deep learning model employing deep learning and ensemble learning. The EDL-COVID model is generated by combining multiple snapshot models of COVID-Net, which has pioneered in an open-sourced COVID-19 case detection method with deep neural network processed chest X-ray images, by employing a proposed weighted averaging ensembling method that is aware of different sensitivities of deep learning models on different classes types.

"One of the most symptomatic diseases is COVID-19. Early and precise physiological measurement-based prediction of breathing will minimize the risk of COVID-19 by a reasonable distance from anyone; wearing a mask, cleanliness, medication, balanced diet, and if not well stay safe at home.

COVID-19 datasets from the Repository were combined and re-examined to remove incomplete entries, and a total of 2500 cases were utilized in this study. Features of fever, body pain, runny nose, difficulty in breathing, shore throat, and nasal congestion, are considered to be the most important differences between patients who have COVID-19s and those who do not. We exhibit the prediction functionality of five machine learning classifiers. A publicly available data set was used to train and assess the model. With an overall accuracy of 99.88 percent, the ensemble model is performed commendably. When compared to the existing methods and studies, the proposed model is performed better.

"Background: Discover possible Drug Target Interactions (DTIs) is a decisive step in the detection of the effects of drugs as well as drug repositioning. There is a strong incentive to develop effective computational methods that can effectively predict potential DTIs, as traditional DTI laboratory experiments are expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. Some technologies have been developed for this purpose, however large numbers of interactions have not yet been detected, the accuracy of their prediction still low, and protein sequences and structured data are rarely used together in the prediction process. Methods: This paper presents DTIs prediction model that takes advantage of the special capacity of the structured form of proteins and drugs. Our model obtains features from protein amino-acid sequences using physical and chemical properties, and from drugs smiles (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings using encoding techniques. Comparing the proposed model with different existing methods under K-fold cross validation, empirical results show that our model based on ensemble learning algorithms for DTI prediction provide more accurate results from both structures and features data. Results: The proposed model is applied on two datasets:Benchmark (feature only) datasets and DrugBank (Structure data) datasets. Experimental results obtained by Light-Boost and ExtraTree using structures and feature data results in 98 % accuracy and 0.97 f-score comparing to 94 % and 0.92 achieved by the existing methods. Moreover, our model can successfully predict more yet undiscovered interactions, and hence can be used as a practical tool to drug repositioning. A case study of applying our prediction model on the proteins that are known to be affected by Corona viruses in order to predict the possible interactions among these proteins and existing drugs is performed. Also, our model is applied on Covid-19 related drugs announced on DrugBank. The results show that some drugs like DB00691 and DB05203 are predicted with 100 % accuracy to interact with ACE2 protein. This protein is a self-membrane protein that enables Covid-19 infection. Hence, our model can be used as an effective tool in drug reposition to predict possible drug treatments for Covid-19. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Covid-19; Deep-learning; Drug-target interactions; Drugs; Machine learning; Prediction; Proteins
"On 11 March 2020, the (WHO) World Health Organization declared COVID-19 (CoronaVirus Disease 2019) as a pandemic. A further crisis has manifested mass fear and panic, driven by lack of information, or sometimes outright misinformation, alongside the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter is one of the prominent and trusted social media in this current outbreak. Over time, boundless COVID-19 headlines and vast awareness have been spreading, with tweets, updates, videos, and explosive posts. Few studies have been performed on the pandemic to detect and interrelate various disease types, including current coronavirus. However, it is pretty tricky to discriminate and detect a specific category. This work is motivated by the need to inform society about limiting irrelevant information and avoiding spreading negative emotions. In this context, the current work focuses on informative tweet detection in the pandemic to provide relevant information to the government, medical organizations, victims services, etc. This paper used a Majority Voting technique-based Ensemble Deep Learning (MVEDL) model. This MVEDL model is used to identify COVID-19 related (INFORMATIVE) tweets. The state-of-art deep learning models RoBERTa, BERTweet, and CT-BERT are used for best performance with the MVEDL model. The “COVID-19 English labeled tweets” dataset is used for training and testing the MVEDL model. The MVEDL model has shown 91.75 percent accuracy, 91.14 percent F1-score and outperforms the traditional machine learning and deep learning models. We also investigate how to use the MVEDL model for sentiment analysis on 226668 unlabeled COVID-19 tweets and their informative tweets. The application section discussed a comprehensive analysis of both actual and informative tweets. According to our knowledge, this is the first work on COVID-19 sentiment analysis using a deep learning ensemble model. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",BERTweet; COVID-19; CT-BERT; Deep learning; Health emergency; Informative tweets; Majority voting; RoBERTa; Sentiment analysis
"The pandemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading all over the world. Medical health care systems are in urgent need to diagnose this pandemic with the support of new emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and Big Data System. In this dichotomy study, we divide our research in two ways—firstly, the review of literature is carried out on databases of Elsevier, Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed and Wiley Online using keywords Coronavirus, Covid-19, artificial intelligence on Covid-19, Coronavirus 2019 and collected the latest information about Covid-19. Possible applications are identified from the same to enhance the future research. We have found various databases, websites and dashboards working on real time extraction of Covid-19 data. This will be conducive for future research to easily locate the available information. Secondly, we designed a nested ensemble model using deep learning methods based on long short term memory (LSTM). Proposed Deep-LSTM ensemble model is evaluated on intensive care Covid-19 confirmed and death cases of India with different classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure and mean absolute percentage error. Medical healthcare facilities are boosted with the intervention of AI as it can mimic human intelligence. Contactless treatment is possible only with the help of AI assisted automated health care systems. Furthermore, remote location self treatment is one of the key benefits provided by AI based systems. © 2021, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.",Artificial intelligence; Covid-19; Deep learning; LSTM; Nested ensemble
"Because of the catastrophic outbreak of global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its strong infectivity and possible persistence, computational repurposing of existing approved drugs will be a promising strategy that facilitates rapid clinical treatment decisions and provides reasonable justification for subsequent clinical trials and regulatory reviews. Since the effects of a small number of conditionally marketed vaccines need further clinical observation, there is still an urgent need to quickly and effectively repurpose potentially available drugs before the next disease peak. In this work, we have manually collected a set of experimentally confirmed virus-drug associations through the publicly published database and literature, consisting of 175 drugs and 95 viruses, as well as 933 virus-drug associations. Then, because the samples are extremely sparse and unbalanced, negative samples cannot be easily obtained. We have developed an ensemble model, EMC-Voting, based on matrix completion and weighted soft voting, a semi-supervised machine learning model for computational drug repurposing. Finally, we have evaluated the prediction performance of EMC-Voting by fivefold crossing-validation and compared it with other baseline classifiers and prediction models. The case study for the virus SARS-COV-2 included in the dataset demonstrates that our model achieves the outperforming AUPR value of 0.934 in virus-drug association’s prediction. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Wang and Xu.",computational drug repurposing; matrix completion; SARS-CoV-2; virus-drug association prediction; weighted voting ensemble model
"COVID-19 is a deadly disease, and should be efficiently detected. COVID-19 shares similar symptoms with pneumonia, another type of lung disease, which remains a cause of morbidity and mortality. This article aims to demonstrate an ensemble deep learning approach that can differentiate COVID-19 and pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. The original X-ray images were processed to produce two sets of images with different features. The first set was images enhanced with contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization. The second set was edge images produced by contrast-enhanced canny edge detection. Convolutional neural networks were used to extract features from the images and train classifiers, which were able to classify COVID-19, pneumonia, and healthy lungs cases. Results show that the classifiers were able to differentiate X-rays of different classes, where the best performing ensemble achieved an overall accuracy of 97.90%, with a sensitivity of 99.47%, and specificity of 98.94% for COVID-19 detection. © 1999-2012 IEEE.",
"Online education becomes increasingly important since traditional learning is shocked heavily by COVID-19. To better develop personalized learning plans for students, it is necessary to build a model that can automatically evaluate students' performance in online education. For this purpose, in this study we propose an ensemble learning method named light gradient boosting channel attention network (LGBCAN), which is based on label distribution estimation. First, the light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) is used to predict the performance in online learning tasks. Then The Channel Attention Network (CAN) model further improves the function of LightGBM by focusing on better results in the K-fold CrossEntropy of LightGBM. The results are converted into predicted classes through post-processing methods named approximation of label distribution to complete the classification task. The experiments are employed on two datasets, data science bowl (DSB) and answer correctness prediction (ACP). The experimental results in both datasets suggest that our model has better robustness and generalization ability. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee Agora University, Oradea, Romania.

"Background: The ongoing fight with Novel Corona Virus, getting quick treatment, and rapid diagnosis reports have become an act of high priority. With millions getting infected daily and a fatality rate of 2%, we made it our motive to contribute a little to solve this real-world problem by accomplishing a significant and substantial method for diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Aim: The Exponential growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide has severely affected the health care system of highly populated countries due to proportionally a smaller number of medical practitioners, testing kits, and other resources, thus becoming essential to identify the infected people. Catering to the above problems, the purpose of this paper is to formulate an accurate, efficient, and time-saving method for detecting positive corona patients. Method: In this paper, an Ensemble Deep Convolution Neural Network model “CoVNet-19” is being proposed that can unveil important diagnostic characteristics to find COVID-19 infected patients using X-ray images chest and help radiologists and medical experts to fight this pandemic. Results: The experimental results clearly show that the overall classification accuracy obtained with the proposed approach for three-class classification among COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Normal is 98.28%, along with an average precision and Recall of 98.33% and 98.33%, respectively. Besides this, for binary classification between Non-COVID and COVID Chest X-ray images, an overall accuracy of 99.71% was obtained. Conclusion: Having a high diagnostic accuracy, our proposed ensemble Deep Learning classification model can be a productive and substantial contribution to detecting COVID-19 infected patients. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Convolution Neural Networks; Coronavirus; Deep Learning; Ensemble Learning; Radiography; Transfer learning
"The COVID-19 lockdown measures gradually implemented in Lombardy (northern Italy) from 23 February 2020 led to a downturn in several economic sectors with possible impacts on air quality. Several communications claimed in the first weeks of March 2020 that the mitigation in air pollution observed at that time was actually related to these lockdown measures without considering that seasonal variations in emissions and meteorology also influence air quality. To determine the specific impact of lockdown measures on air quality in northern Italy, we compared observations from the European Commission Atmospheric Observatory of Ispra (regional background) and from the regional environmental protection agency (ARPA) air monitoring stations in the Milan conurbation (urban background) with expected values for these observations using two different approaches. On the one hand, intensive aerosol variables determined from specific aerosol characterisation observations performed in Ispra were compared to their 3-year averages. On the other hand, ground-level measured concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span, Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span, NO, SOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span) were compared to expected concentrations derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Regional (CAMS) ensemble model forecasts, which did not account for lockdown measures. From these comparisons, we show that NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span concentrations decreased as a consequence of the lockdown by span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-30/span % and span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-40/span % on average at the urban and regional background sites, respectively. Unlike NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span concentrations were not significantly affected by lockdown measures. This could be due to any decreases in PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span (and PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span precursors) emissions from traffic being compensated for by increases in emissions from domestic heating and/or from changes in the secondary aerosol formation regime resulting from the lockdown measures. The implementation of the lockdown measures also led to an increase in the highest Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span concentrations at both the urban and regional background sites resulting from reduced titration of Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span by NO. The relaxation of the lockdown measures beginning in May resulted in close-To-expected NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span concentrations in the urban background and to significant increases in PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span in comparison to expected concentrations at both regional and urban background sites./p. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

"Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Objective: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. Results: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology. Conclusions: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns. © Kathrin Cresswell, Ahsen Tahir, Zakariya Sheikh, Zain Hussain, Andrés Domínguez Hernández, Ewen Harrison, Robin Williams, Aziz Sheikh, Amir Hussain.

"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has infected millions of people around the world, which is leading to the global emergency. In the event of the virus outbreak, it is crucial to get the carriers of the virus timely and precisely, then the animal origins can be isolated for further infection. Traditional identifications rely on fields and laboratory researches that lag the responses to emerging epidemic prevention. With the development of machine learning, the efficiency of predicting the viral hosts has been demonstrated by recent researchers. However, the problems of the limited annotated virus data and imbalanced hosts information restrict these approaches to obtain a better result. To assure the high reliability of predicting the animal origins on COVID-19, we extend transfer learning and ensemble learning to present a hybrid transfer learning model. When predicting the hosts of newly discovered virus, our model provides a novel solution to utilize the related virus domain as auxiliary to help building a robust model for target virus domain. The simulation results on several UCI benchmarks and viral genome datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the general classical methods under the condition of limited target training sets and class-imbalance problems. By setting the coronavirus as target domain and other related virus as source domain, the feasibility of our approach is evaluated. Finally, we show the animal reservoirs prediction of the COVID-19 for further analysing. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",COVID-19; Ensemble learning; Hosts prediction; Machine learning; Transfer learning; Virus origins
"The extensively utilized tool to detect novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR kits are costly and consume critical time, around 6 to 9 hours to classify the subjects as COVID-19(+) or COVID-19(-). Due to the less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it suffers from high false-negative results. To overcome these issues, many deep learning models have been implemented in the literature for the early-stage classification of suspected subjects. To handle the sensitivity issue associated with RT-PCR, chest CT scans are utilized to classify the suspected subjects as COVID-19 (+), tuberculosis, pneumonia, or healthy subjects. The extensive study on chest CT scans of COVID-19 (+) subjects reveals that there are some bilateral changes and unique patterns. But the manual analysis from chest CT scans is a tedious task. Therefore, an automated COVID-19 screening model is implemented by ensembling the deep transfer learning models such as Densely connected convolutional networks (DCCNs), ResNet152V2, and VGG16. Experimental results reveal that the proposed ensemble model outperforms the competitive models in terms of accuracy, f-measure, area under curve, sensitivity, and specificity. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",Chest CT; COVID-19; Deep learning; Transfer learning
"Background: Chest X-ray radiography (CXR) has been widely considered as an accessible, feasible, and convenient method to evaluate suspected patients’ lung involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with the escalating number of suspected cases, traditional diagnosis via CXR fails to deliver results within a short period of time. Therefore, it is crucial to employ artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance CXRs for obtaining quick and accurate diagnoses. Previous studies have reported the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to screen for COVID-19 using CXR and CT results. However, these models only use a single deep learning network for chest radiograph detection; the accuracy of this approach required further improvement. Methods: In this study, we propose a three-step hybrid ensemble model, including a feature extractor, a feature selector, and a classifier. First, a pre-trained AlexNet with an improved structure extracts the original image features. Then, the ReliefF algorithm is adopted to sort the extracted features, and a trial-and-error approach is used to select the n most important features to reduce the feature dimension. Finally, an SVM classifier provides classification results based on the n selected features. Results: Compared to five existing models (InceptionV3: 97.916 ± 0.408%; SqueezeNet: 97.189 ± 0.526%; VGG19: 96.520 ± 1.220%; ResNet50: 97.476 ± 0.513%; ResNet101: 98.241 ± 0.209%), the proposed model demonstrated the best performance in terms of overall accuracy rate (98.642 ± 0.398%). Additionally, compared to the existing models, the proposed model demonstrates a considerable improvement in classification time efficiency (SqueezeNet: 6.602 ± 0.001s; InceptionV3: 12.376 ± 0.002s; ResNet50: 10.952 ± 0.001s; ResNet101: 18.040 ± 0.002s; VGG19: 16.632 ± 0.002s; proposed model: 5.917 ± 0.001s). Conclusion: The model proposed in this article is practical and effective, and can provide high-precision COVID-19 CXR detection. We demonstrated its suitability to aid medical professionals in distinguishing normal CXRs, viral pneumonia CXRs and COVID-19 CXRs efficiently on small sample sizes. © 2021",COVID-19; Dimension reduction; Transfer learning; X-ray imaging
"COVID-19 has caused severe health complications and produced a substantial adverse economic impact around the world. Forecasting the trend of COVID-19 infections could help in executing policies to effectively reduce the number of new cases. In this study,we apply the decomposition and ensemble model to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in Pakistan for the upcoming month until the end of July. For the decomposition of data, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) technique is applied. EEMD decomposes the data into small components, called Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). For individual IMFs modelling, we use the Autoregressive IntegratedMoving Average (ARIMA) model. The data used in this study is obtained from the official website of Pakistan that is publicly available and designated for COVID-19 outbreak with daily updates. Our analyses reveal that the number of recoveries, new cases, and deaths are increasing in Pakistan exponentially. Based on the selected EEMD-ARIMA model, the new confirmed cases are expected to rise from 213,470 to 311,454 by 31 July 2020, which is an increase of almost 1.46 times with a 95% prediction interval of 246,529 to 376,379. The 95% prediction interval for recovery is 162,414 to 224,579, with an increase of almost two times in total from 100802 to 193495 by 31 July 2020. On the other hand, the deaths are expected to increase from 4395 to 6751, which is almost 1.54 times, with a 95% prediction interval of 5617 to 7885. Thus, the COVID-19 forecasting results of Pakistan are alarming for the next month until 31 July 2020. They also confirm that the EEMD-ARIMA model is useful for the short-termforecasting of COVID-19, and that it is capable of keeping track of the real COVID-19 data in nearly all scenarios. The decomposition and ensemble strategy can be useful to help decision-makers in developing short-term strategies about the current number of disease occurrences until an appropriate vaccine is developed. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

"OBJECTIVE: Risk prediction models are widely used to inform evidence-based clinical decision making. However, few models developed from single cohorts can perform consistently well at population level where diverse prognoses exist (such as the SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2] pandemic). This study aims at tackling this challenge by synergizing prediction models from the literature using ensemble learning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we selected and reimplemented 7 prediction models for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) that were derived from diverse cohorts and used different implementation techniques. A novel ensemble learning framework was proposed to synergize them for realizing personalized predictions for individual patients. Four diverse international cohorts (2 from the United Kingdom and 2 from China; N?=?5394) were used to validate all 8 models on discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Results showed that individual prediction models could perform well on some cohorts while poorly on others. Conversely, the ensemble model achieved the best performances consistently on all metrics quantifying discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Performance disparities were observed in cohorts from the 2 countries: all models achieved better performances on the China cohorts. DISCUSSION: When individual models were learned from complementary cohorts, the synergized model had the potential to achieve better performances than any individual model. Results indicate that blood parameters and physiological measurements might have better predictive powers when collected early, which remains to be confirmed by further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Combining a diverse set of individual prediction models, the ensemble method can synergize a robust and well-performing model by choosing the most competent ones for individual patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

"During the COVID-19 pandemic, dermatologists reported an array of different cutaneous manifestations of the disease. It is challenging to discriminate COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations from other closely resembling skin lesions. The aim of this study was to generate and evaluate a novel CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) ensemble architecture for detection of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from clinical images. An ensemble model of three different CNN-based algorithms was trained with clinical images of skin lesions from confirmed COVID-19 positive patients, healthy controls as well as 18 other common skin conditions, which included close mimics of COVID-19 skin lesions such as urticaria, varicella, pityriasis rosea, herpes zoster, bullous pemphigoid and psoriasis. The multi-class model demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 86.7% for all 20 diseases. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19-rash detection were found to be 84.2 ± 5.1% and 99.5 ± 0.2%, respectively. The positive predictive value, NPV and area under curve values for COVID-19-rash were 88.0 ± 5.6%, 99.4 ± 0.2% and 0.97 ± 0.25, respectively. The binary classifier had a mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76.81 ± 6.25%, 99.77 ± 0.14% and 98.91 ± 0.17%, respectively for COVID-19 rash. The model was robust in detection of all skin lesions on both white and skin of color, although only a few images of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from skin of color were available. To our best knowledge, this is the first machine learning-based study for automated detection of COVID-19 based on skin images and may provide a useful decision support tool for physicians to optimize contact-free COVID-19 triage, differential diagnosis of skin lesions and patient care. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",artificial intelligence; COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations; COVID-19 skin lesions; deep learning
"With the recent spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has received more attention. The most important CAD application is to detect and classify pneumonia diseases using X-ray images, especially, in a critical period as pandemic of covid-19 that is kind of pneumonia. In this work, we aim to evaluate the performance of single and ensemble learning models for the pneumonia disease classification. The ensembles used are mainly based on fined-tuned versions of (InceptionResNet_V2, ResNet50 and MobileNet_V2). We collected a new dataset containing 6087 chest X-ray images in which we conduct comprehensive experiments. As a result, for a single model, we found out that InceptionResNet_V2 gives 93.52% of F1 score. In addition, ensemble of 3 models (ResNet50 with MobileNet_V2 with InceptionResNet_V2) shows more accurate than other ensembles constructed (94.84% of F1 score). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd. part of Springer Nature.",Computer-aided diagnosis; Covid-19; Deep learning; Ensemble deep learning; Pneumonia disease; Pneumonia multiclass classification; X-ray images
"Objective: The study sought to test the possibility of differentiating chest x-ray images of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) against other pneumonia and healthy patients using deep neural networks. Materials and Methods: We construct the radiography (x-ray) imaging data from 2 publicly available sources, which include 5508 chest x-ray images across 2874 patients with 4 classes: normal, bacterial pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and COVID-19. To identify COVID-19, we propose a FLANNEL (Focal Loss bAsed Neural Network EnsembLe) model, a flexible module to ensemble several convolutional neural network models and fuse with a focal loss for accurate COVID-19 detection on class imbalance data. Results: FLANNEL consistently outperforms baseline models on COVID-19 identification task in all metrics. Compared with the best baseline, FLANNEL shows a higher macro-F1 score, with 6% relative increase on the COVID-19 identification task, in which it achieves precision of 0.7833 ± 0.07, recall of 0.8609 ± 0.03, and F1 score of 0.8168 ± 0.03. Discussion: Ensemble learning that combines multiple independent basis classifiers can increase the robustness and accuracy. We propose a neural weighing module to learn the importance weight for each base model and combine them via weighted ensemble to get the final classification results. In order to handle the class imbalance challenge, we adapt focal loss to our multiple classification task as the loss function. Conclusion: FLANNEL effectively combines state-of-The-Art convolutional neural network classification models and tackles class imbalance with focal loss to achieve better performance on COVID-19 detection from x-rays. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

"Importance: In early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear. Objective: To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter. Results: Of 5424688 inpatient encounters among 3372839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2823748 [52.1%] boys; 3171224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43550 [42110-43946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4327580511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5983142102 [$5762690022-$6324978456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.",
"Background: Currently, existing biomedical literature repositories do not commonly provide users with specific means to locate and remotely access biomedical databases. Objective: To address this issue, we developed the Biomedical Database Inventory (BiDI), a repository linking to biomedical databases automatically extracted from the scientific literature. BiDI provides an index of data resources and a path to access them seamlessly. Methods: We designed an ensemble of deep learning methods to extract database mentions. To train the system, we annotated a set of 1242 articles that included mentions of database publications. Such a data set was used along with transfer learning techniques to train an ensemble of deep learning natural language processing models targeted at database publication detection. Results: The system obtained an F1 score of 0.929 on database detection, showing high precision and recall values. When applying this model to the PubMed and PubMed Central databases, we identified over 10,000 unique databases. The ensemble model also extracted the weblinks to the reported databases and discarded irrelevant links. For the extraction of weblinks, the model achieved a cross-validated F1 score of 0.908. We show two use cases: one related to “omics” and the other related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: BiDI enables access to biomedical resources over the internet and facilitates data-driven research and other scientific initiatives. The repository is openly available online and will be regularly updated with an automatic text processing pipeline. The approach can be reused to create repositories of different types (ie, biomedical and others). © Eduardo Rosado, Miguel Garcia-Remesal, Sergio Paraiso-Medina, Alejandro Pazos, Victor Maojo.",Biomedical databases; Biomedical knowledge; Deep learning; Internet; Natural language processing
"Background: During a pandemic, it is important for clinicians to stratify patients and decide who receives limited medical resources. Machine learning models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one machine learning algorithm and limited performance evaluation to area under the curve analysis. To obtain the best results possible, it may be important to test different machine learning algorithms to find the best prediction model. Objective: In this study, we aimed to use automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted patients’ chances of surviving a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, we identified which variables (ie, vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc) were the most influential in generating an accurate model. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from all patients who tested positive for COVID-19 at our institution between March 1 and July 3, 2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time (ie, real-time polymerase chain reaction positivity). Patients were followed for 30 days or until death. Patients’ data were used to build 20 machine learning models with various algorithms via autoML. The performance of machine learning models was measured by analyzing the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPCR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability via Shapley additive explanation and partial dependence plots to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions. Afterward, we conducted dimensionality reduction to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML models were retrained by only using these 10 variables, and the output models were evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. Results: Data from 4313 patients were used to develop the models. The best model that was generated by using autoML and 48 variables was the stacked ensemble model (AUPRC=0.807). The two best independent models were the gradient boost machine and extreme gradient boost models, which had an AUPRC of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. The deep learning model (AUPRC=0.73) was substantially inferior to the other models. The 10 most influential variables for generating high-performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry level, blood urea nitrogen level, lactate dehydrogenase level, D-dimer level, troponin level, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. After the autoML models were retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model still had the best performance (AUPRC=0.791). Conclusions: We used autoML to develop high-performing models that predicted the survival of patients with COVID-19. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method for generating machine learning–based clinical decision support tools. © Kenji Ikemura, Eran Bellin, Yukako Yagi, Henny Billett, Mahmoud Saada, Katelyn Simone, Lindsay Stahl, James Szymanski, D Y Goldstein, Morayma Reyes Gil.",Automated machine learning; Biomarker; COVID-19; Decision support; Decision support tool; Dimensionality reduction; Machine learning; Partial dependence plot; Ranking; Shapley additive explanation
"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a serious health crisis, and information obtained from disease transmission models fitted to observed data is needed to inform containment strategies. As the transmission of virus varies from city to city in different countries, we use a two-level individual-level model to analyze the spatiotemporal SARS-CoV-2 spread. However, inference procedures such as Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo, which is commonly used to estimate parameters of ILMs, are computationally expensive. In this study, we use trained ensemble learning classifiers to estimate the parameters of two-level ILMs and show that the fitted ILMs can successfully capture the virus transmission among Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province, China. © Copyright © 2021 Liu, Deardon, Fu, Ferdous, Ware and Cheng.",COVID-19 epidemic; ensemble learning classifiers; individual-level model; SARS-CoV-2 transmission; spatiotemporal analysis
"Coronavirus has infected many countries across the globe and is still spreading. As health sectors are experiencing an unexpected rise in cases each day, researchers are perpetually trying to discover a permanent antidote for the virus. Considering the spread, it becomes imperative to predict the spread of disease to mitigate the spread. This paper proposes a stacked ensemble model to predict occurrences of COVID-19 using Exponential Smoothing (ETS), Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Neural Network Auto-regression (NNAR) as the base models. Each base model is trained individually on the disease data set, whose regress values are then used to train the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The stacked ensemble model outperforms the base models in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results conclude that the ensemble model is competent to forecast future COVID incidences in comparison to other statistical time series models.

"Purpose: COVID-19, a global pandemic, first appeared in the city of Wuhan, China, and has since spread differently across geographical borders, classes, and genders from various age groups, sometimes mutating its DNA strands in the process. The sheer magnitude of the pandemic's spread is putting a strain on hospitals and medical facilities. The need of the hour is to deploy IoT devices and robots to monitor patients' body vitals as well as their other pathological data to further control the spread. There has not been a more compelling need to use digital advances to remotely provide quality healthcare via computing devices and AI-powered medical aids. Method: This research developed a deployable Internet of Things (IoT) based infrastructure for the early and simple detection and isolation of suspected coronavirus patients, which was accomplished via the use of ensemble deep transfer learning. The proposed Internet of Things framework combines 4 different deep learning models: DenseNet201, VGG16, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet152V2. Utilizing the deep ensemble model, the medical modalities are used to obtain chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images and diagnose the infection. Results: Over the HRCT image dataset, the developed deep ensemble model is collated to different state-of-the-art transfer learning (TL) models. The comparative investigation demonstrated that the suggested approach can aid radiologists inefficiently and swiftly diagnosing probable coronavirus patients. Conclusion: For the first time, our group has developed an AI-enabled Decision Support System to automate the entire process flow from estimation to detection of COVID-19 subjects as part of an Intelligent Value Chain algorithm. The screening is expected to eliminate the false negatives and asymptomatic ones out of the equation and hence the affected individuals could be identified in a total process time of 15 minutes to 1 hour. A Complete Deployable System with AI Influenced Prediction is described here for the first time. Not only did the authors suggest a Multiple Hypothesis based Decision Fusion Algorithm for forecasting the outcome, but they also did the predictive analytics. For simple confined isolation or hospitalization, this complete Predictive System was encased within an IoT ecosystem. © 2021 Lifescience Global.

"This study proposes an ensemble deep learning approach that integrates Bagging Ridge (BR) regression with Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks used as base regressors to become a Bi-LSTM BR approach. Bi-LSTM BR was used to predict the exchange rates of 21 currencies against the USD during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model, we compared the prediction performance with several more traditional machine learning algorithms, such as the regression tree, support vector regression, and random forest regression, and deep learning-based algorithms such as LSTM and Bi-LSTM. Our proposed ensemble deep learning approach outperformed the compared models in forecasting exchange rates in terms of prediction error. However, the performance of the model significantly varied during non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods across currencies, indicating the essential role of prediction models in periods of highly volatile foreign currency markets. By providing an improved prediction performance and identifying the most seriously affected currencies, this study is beneficial for foreign exchange traders and other stakeholders in that it offers opportunities for potential trading profitability and for reducing the impact of increased currency risk during the pandemic. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bagging ridge; Bi-LSTM; COVID-19; Deep learning; Exchange rate forecasting; Machine learning
"Pneumonia is a disease caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which could be fatal if timely medical care is not provided. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, the most common diagnosis for severe COVID-19 is severe pneumonia. The most common method of detecting Pneumonia is through chest X-ray which is a very time intensive process and requires a skilled expert. The rapid development in the field of deep learning and neural networks in recent years has led to drastic improvement in automation of pneumonia detection from analysing chest x-rays. In this paper, a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) on chest x-ray images is used as feature extractors which are then further processed to classify the images in order to predict whether a person has pneumonia or not. The different pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks used are assessed with various parameters regarding their predictions on the images. The results of pre-trained neural networks were examined, and an ensemble model was proposed that combines the predictions of the best pre-trained models to produce better results than individual models. © 2021",Deep neural networks; ensemble learning; pneumonia detection using x-ray images; transfer learning
"Background: One of the most challenging aspects related to Covid-19 is to establish the presence of infection in an early phase of the disease. Texture analysis might be an additional tool for the evaluation of Chest X-ray in patients with clinical suspicion of Covid-19 related pneumo-nia. Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis and machine learning models for the diagnosis of Covid-19 interstitial pneumonia in Chest X-ray images. Methods: Chest X-ray images were accessed from a publicly available repository(https://www.kag-gle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Lung areas were manually segmented using a polygonal region of interest covering both lung areas, using MaZda, a freely available software for texture analysis. A total of 308 features per ROI was extracted. One hundred-ten Covid-19 Chest X-ray images were selected for the final analysis. Results: Six models, namely NB, GLM, DL, GBT, ANN, and PLS-DA were selected and ensem-bled. According to Youden’s index, the Covid-19 Ensemble Machine Learning Score showing the highest area under the curve (0.971±0.015) was 132.57. Assuming this cut-off the Ensemble model performance was estimated by evaluating both true and false positive/negative, resulting in 91.8% accuracy with 93% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Moving the cut-off value to-100, although the accuracy resulted lower (90.6%), the Ensemble Machine Learning showed 100% sensitivity, with 80% specificity. Conclusion: Texture analysis of Chest X-ray images and machine learning algorithms may help in differentiating patients with Covid-19 pneumonia. Despite several limitations, this study can lay the ground for future research works in this field and help to develop more rapid and accurate screening tools for these patients. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",COVID-19; Interstitial pneumonia; Pneumonia; Radiomics; Texture analysis; Thorax; X-ray
"Pandemic events, particularly the current Covid-19 disease, compel organisations to re-formulate their day-to-day operations for achieving various business goals such as cost reduction. Unfortunately, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) making up more than 95% of all businesses is the hardest hit sector. This has urged SMEs to rethink their operations to survive through pandemic events. One key area is the use of new technologies pertaining to digital transformation for optimizing pandemic preparedness and minimizing business disruptions. This is especially true from the perspective of digitizing asset management methodologies in the era of Industry 4.0 under pandemic environments. Incidentally, human-centric approaches have become increasingly important in predictive maintenance through the exploitation of digital tools, especially when the workforce is increasingly interacting with new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet-of-Things devices for condition monitoring in equipment maintenance services. In this research, we propose an AI-based human-centric decision support framework for predictive maintenance in asset management, which can facilitate prompt and informed decision-making under pandemic environments. For predictive maintenance of complex systems, an enhanced trust-based ensemble model is introduced to undertake imbalanced data issues. A human-in-the-loop mechanism is incorporated to exploit the tacit knowledge elucidated from subject matter experts for providing decision support. Evaluations with both benchmark and real-world databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for addressing imbalanced data issues in predictive maintenance tasks. In the real-world case study, an accuracy rate of 82% is achieved, which indicates the potential of the proposed framework in assisting business sustainability pertaining to asset predictive maintenance under pandemic environments. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial Intelligence; Asset management; Decision support; Pandemic preparedness; Predictive maintenance; Small and medium enterprises
"At the macroeconomic level, the movement of the stock market index, which is determined by the moves of other stock market indices around the world or in that region, is one of the primary factors in assessing the global economic and financial situation, making it a critical topic to monitor over time. As a result, the potential to reliably forecast the future value of stock market indices by taking trade relationships into account is critical. The aim of the research is to create a time-series data forecasting model that incorporates the best features of many time-series data analysis models. The hybrid ensemble model built in this study is made up of two main components, each with its own set of functions derived from the CNN and LSTM models. For multiple parallel financial time-series estimation, the proposed model is called multivariate CNN-LSTM. The effectiveness of the evolved ensemble model during the COVID-19 pandemic was tested using regular stock market indices from four Asian stock markets: Shanghai, Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia. In contrast to CNN and LSTM, the experimental results show that multivariate CNN-LSTM has the highest statistical accuracy and reliability (smallest RMSE value). This finding supports the use of multivariate CNN-LSTM to forecast the value of different stock market indices and that it is a viable choice for research involving the development of models for the study of financial time-series prediction. © 2021 Harya Widiputra et al.",
"A genetically heterogeneous infectious virus recognized as COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease) has a significant influence on worldwide health. COVID-19 is an infection transmitted by a viral disease known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2. (SARS-CoV-2). In the current period, the instances of COVID-19 outbreaks are spreading significantly over the globe. Swallowed (through inhalation) or contact with contaminated droplets transmits the illness. Symptoms appear from two to fourteen days after exposure. Many individuals have a symptomless infection. The emphasis of therapy is on fundamental human needs; further research is needed on the risk analysis of the disease and use of antiviral medications. This research focuses on the case instances through the chronological dates in various parts of Indian states. The primary analysis of case instance is dependent on three stages; they are confirming stage, fatality stage, and recovered stage. The relevant datasets are obtained through Kaggle (from January 2020 to May 2021). The dataset has multiple categories that further intensify to perform high-end classifications. Initially, data preprocessing is done that include cleaning and feature selection on the prepared dataset, and then the prediction process is carried out using an Ensemble training approach. Approaches of Ensemble learning utilize many learning algorithms to achieve improved prediction efficiency. The stacking mechanism is used for aggregating accuracy. From the experimental observations, the suggested learning strategy is found to attain the maximum degree of precision for each stage (confirmed: 84.37%, fatality: 82.13%, and recovered: 88.67%) compared to the other approaches that are chosen to perform alone. Assessing the stability of the learning model is done by bootstrapping validation. © 2021, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",Bootstrapping validation; COVID-19; Ensemble learning; Fatality; K-fold cross-validation; Risk analysis
"Importance: Machine learning could be used to predict the likelihood of diagnosis and severity of illness. Lack of COVID-19 patient data has hindered the data science community in developing models to aid in the response to the pandemic. Objectives: To describe the rapid development and evaluation of clinical algorithms to predict COVID-19 diagnosis and hospitalization using patient data by citizen scientists, provide an unbiased assessment of model performance, and benchmark model performance on subgroups. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic and prognostic study operated a continuous, crowdsourced challenge using a model-to-data approach to securely enable the use of regularly updated COVID-19 patient data from the University of Washington by participants from May 6 to December 23, 2020. A postchallenge analysis was conducted from December 24, 2020, to April 7, 2021, to assess the generalizability of models on the cumulative data set as well as subgroups stratified by age, sex, race, and time of COVID-19 test. By December 23, 2020, this challenge engaged 482 participants from 90 teams and 7 countries. Main Outcomes and Measures: Machine learning algorithms used patient data and output a score that represented the probability of patients receiving a positive COVID-19 test result or being hospitalized within 21 days after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result. Algorithms were evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC) scores. Ensemble models aggregating models from the top challenge teams were developed and evaluated. Results: In the analysis using the cumulative data set, the best performance for COVID-19 diagnosis prediction was an AUROC of 0.776 (95% CI, 0.775-0.777) and an AUPRC of 0.297, and for hospitalization prediction, an AUROC of 0.796 (95% CI, 0.794-0.798) and an AUPRC of 0.188. Analysis on top models submitting to the challenge showed consistently better model performance on the female group than the male group. Among all age groups, the best performance was obtained for the 25- to 49-year age group, and the worst performance was obtained for the group aged 17 years or younger. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic and prognostic study, models submitted by citizen scientists achieved high performance for the prediction of COVID-19 testing and hospitalization outcomes. Evaluation of challenge models on demographic subgroups and prospective data revealed performance discrepancies, providing insights into the potential bias and limitations in the models.. © 2021 American Medical Association.

"Globally, COVID-19 already emerged in around 170 million confirmed cases of infected people and, as of May 31, 2021, affected more than 3.54 million deaths. This pandemic has given rise to numerous public health and socioeconomic issues, emphasizing the significance of unraveling the epidemic’s history and forecasting the disease’s potential dynamics. A variety of mathematical models have been proposed to obtain a deeper understanding of disease transmission mechanisms. Machine Learning (ML) models have been used in the last decade to identify patterns and enhance prediction efficiency in healthcare applications. This paper proposes a model to predict COVID-19 patients admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). The model is built upon robust known classification algorithms, including classic Machine Learning Classifiers (MLCs), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and ensemble learning. This model’s strength in predicting COVID-19 infected patients is shown by performance analysis of various MLCs and error metrics. Among other used ML models, the ANN model resulted in the highest accuracy, 97.9% over other models. Mean Squared Error showed that the ANN method had the lowest error (0.0809). In conclusion, this paper could be beneficial to ICU staff to predict ICU admission based on COVID-19 patients’ clinical characteristics. © 2021.

"The world has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019. Timely and efficient diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected patients plays a significant role in medical treatment. The deep transfer learning-based automated COVID-19 diagnosis on chest X-ray is required to counter the COVID-19 outbreak. This work proposes a real-time Internet of Things (IoT) framework for early diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 patients by using ensemble deep transfer learning. The proposed framework offers real-time communication and diagnosis of COVID-19 suspected cases. The proposed IoT framework ensembles four deep learning models such as InceptionResNetV2, ResNet152V2, VGG16, and DenseNet201.

"In recent decades, automatic vehicle classification plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems and visual traffic surveillance systems. Especially in countries that imposed a lockdown (mobility restrictions help reduce the spread of COVID-19), it becomes important to curtail the movement of vehicles as much as possible. For an effective visual traffic surveillance system, it is essential to detect vehicles from the images and classify the vehicles into different types (e.g., bus, car, and pickup truck). Most of the existing research studies focused only on maximizing the percentage of predictions, which have poor real-time performance and consume more computing resources. To highlight the problems of classifying imbalanced data, a new technique is proposed in this research article for vehicle type classification. Initially, the data are collected from the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset and the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset. In addition, adaptive histogram equalization and the Gaussian mixture model are implemented for enhancing the quality of collected vehicle images and to detect vehicles from the denoised images. Then, the Steerable Pyramid Transform and the Weber Local Descriptor are employed to extract the feature vectors from the detected vehicles. Finally, the extracted features are given as the input to an ensemble deep learning technique for vehicle classification. In the simulation phase, the proposed ensemble deep learning technique obtained 99.13% and 99.28% of classification accuracy on the MIOvision Traffic Camera Dataset and the Beijing Institute of Technology Vehicle Dataset. The obtained results are effective compared to the standard existing benchmark techniques on both datasets. © 2021 Preetha Jagannathan et al.",
"Around the world, more than 250 countries are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This outbreak can be controlled only by the diagnosis of the COVID-19 infection in early stages. It is found that the radiographic images are ideal for the fastest diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. This paper proposes an ensemble model which detects the COVID-19 infection in the early stage with the use of chest X-ray images. The transfer learning enables to reuse the pretrained models. The ensemble learning integrates various transfer learning models, i.e., EfficientNet, GoogLeNet, and XceptionNet, to design the proposed model. These models can categorize patients as COVID-19 (+), pneumonia (+), tuberculosis (+), or healthy. The proposed model enhances the classifier’s generalization ability for both binary and multiclass COVID-19 datasets. Two popular datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble model. The comparative analysis validates that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art models in terms of various performance metrics. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",COVID-19; Ensemble; Infection; Transfer learning
"The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has impacted numerous areas of people's work and free-time activities. This article aims to present the main impacts of the COVID-19 movement restrictions on the road traffic in the Czech Republic, measured during the first epidemic wave, i.e., from 12 March to 17 May 2020. The state of emergency was imposed by the Czech government as a de jure measure for coping with the perceived crisis, although the measure eventually resulted only in a quite liberal de facto form of stay-at-home instruction. Unique country-scale traffic data of the first six months of 2020 from 37,002 km of roads, constituting 66% of all roads in the Czech Republic, were collected and analyzed. For the prediction of the prepandemic traffic conditions and their comparison with the measured values in the period of the state of emergency, a long-term traffic speed prediction ensemble model consisting of case-based reasoning, linear regression, and fallback submodels was used. The authors found out that the COVID-19 movement restrictions had a significant impact on the country-wide traffic. Traffic density was reduced considerably in the first three weeks, and the weekly average traffic speed in all road types increased by up to 21%, expectedly due to less crowded roads. The exception was motorways, where a different trend in traffic was found. In sum, during the first three weeks of the state of emergency, people followed government regulations and restrictions and changed their travel behavior accordingly. However, following this period, the traffic gradually returned to the prepandemic state. This occurred three weeks before the state of emergency was terminated. From a behavioral perspective, this article briefly discusses the possible causes of such discrepancies between de jure and de facto pandemic measures, i.e., the governmental communication strategy related to loosening of movement restrictions, media reality, and certain culture-related traits. © 2021 Milan Simunek et al.",
"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can be deadly to people, causing COVID-19. The ease of its propagation, coupled with its high capacity for illness and death in infected individuals, makes it a hazard to the community. Chest X-rays are one of the most common but most difficult to interpret radiographic examination for early diagnosis of coronavirus-related infections. They carry a considerable amount of anatomical and physiological information, but it is sometimes difficult even for the expert radiologist to derive the related information they contain. Automatic classification using deep learning models can help in better assessing these infections swiftly. Deep CNN models, namely, MobileNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were applied with different variations, including training the model from the start, fine-tuning along with adjusting learned weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with learned weights along with augmentation. Fine-tuning with augmentation produced the best results in pretrained models. Out of these, two best-performing models (MobileNet and InceptionV3) selected for ensemble learning produced accuracy and FScore of 95.18% and 90.34%, and 95.75% and 91.47%, respectively. The proposed hybrid ensemble model generated with the merger of these deep models produced a classification accuracy and FScore of 96.49% and 92.97%. For test dataset, which was separately kept, the model generated accuracy and FScore of 94.19% and 88.64%. Automatic classification using deep ensemble learning can help radiologists in the correct identification of coronavirus-related infections in chest X-rays. Consequently, this swift and computer-aided diagnosis can help in saving precious human lives and minimizing the social and economic impact on society. © 2021 Fareed Ahmad et al.",
"COVID-19 has emerged as a global crisis with unprecedented socio-economic challenges, jeopardizing our lives and livelihoods for years to come. The unavailability of vaccines for COVID-19 has rendered rapid testing of the population instrumental in order to contain the exponential rise in cases of infection. Shortage of RT-PCR test kits and delays in obtaining test results calls for alternative methods of rapid and reliable diagnosis. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based solution using chest X-rays which can help in rapid triaging of COVID-19 patients. The proposed solution uses image enhancement, image segmentation, and employs a modified stacked ensemble model consisting of four CNN base-learners along with Naive Bayes as meta-learner to classify chest X-rays into three classes viz. COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. An effective pruning strategy as introduced in the proposed framework results in increased model performance, generalizability, and decreased model complexity. We incorporate explainability in our article by using Grad-CAM visualization in order to establish trust in the medical AI system. Furthermore, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art GAN architectures and their ability to generate realistic synthetic samples of COVID-19 chest X-rays to deal with limited numbers of training samples. The proposed solution significantly outperforms existing methods, with 98.67% accuracy, 0.98 Kappa score, and F-1 scores of 100, 98, and 98 for COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia classes, respectively, on standard datasets.

"Socioeconomic reasons post-COVID-19 demand unsupervised home-based rehabilitation and, specifically, artificial ambient intelligence with individualisation to support engagement and motivation. Artificial intelligence must also comply with accountability, responsibility, and transparency (ART) requirements for wider acceptability. This paper presents such a patient-centric individualised home-based rehabilitation support system. To this end, the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Five Time Sit To Stand (FTSTS) tests evaluate daily living activity performance in the presence or development of comorbidities. We present a method for generating synthetic datasets complementing experimental observations and mitigating bias. We present an incremental hybrid machine learning algorithm combining ensemble learning and hybrid stacking using extreme gradient boosted decision trees and k-nearest neighbours to meet individualisation, interpretability, and ART design requirements while maintaining low computation footprint. The model reaches up to 100% accuracy for both FTSTS and TUG in predicting associated patient medical condition, and 100% or 83.13%, respectively, in predicting area of difficulty in the segments of the test. Our results show an improvement of 5% and 15% for FTSTS and TUG tests, respectively, over previous approaches that use intrusive means of monitoring such as cameras. © 2020 by the authors.

"The rapid detection of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has a positive effect on preventing propagation and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. This article focuses on the rapid detection of COVID-19. We propose an ensemble deep learning model for novel COVID-19 detection from CT images. 2933 lung CT images from COVID-19 patients were obtained from previous publications, authoritative media reports, and public databases. The images were preprocessed to obtain 2500 high-quality images. 2500 CT images of lung tumor and 2500 from normal lung were obtained from a hospital. Transfer learning was used to initialize model parameters and pretrain three deep convolutional neural network models: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and ResNet. These models were used for feature extraction on all images. Softmax was used as the classification algorithm of the fully connected layer. The ensemble classifier EDL-COVID was obtained via relative majority voting. Finally, the ensemble classifier was compared with three component classifiers to evaluate accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F value, and Matthews correlation coefficient. The results showed that the overall classification performance of the ensemble model was better than that of the component classifier. The evaluation indexes were also higher. This algorithm can better meet the rapid detection requirements of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",COVID-19; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Lung CT images
"The novel coronavirus has spread quite rapidly across the globe. The current testing rate is failing to match the exponential rate of rising cases. Moreover, the available testing methodologies are expensive and time-consuming. A sensitive automated diagnosis is one of the biggest need of the hour. In the proposed work, the authors analyse the chest X-ray images of normal, pneumonia and coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients and process them to boost the COVID-specific features (opacities etc.), which enable to perform sensitive identification of COVID-19 patients. The sets of original and processed images are used with a stack of pre-trained deep models for ensemble learning. They used VGG-16 as baselearners, trained with a diverse set of inputs followed by a logistic regression model, the meta learner, to combine the baselearner predictions. The proposed fusion-based model is trained and tested for three types of classification, TYPE-I: Binary (NORMAL/ABNORMAL), TYPE-II: Binary (PNEUMONIA/COVID-19) and TYPE-III: Multi-class (NORMAL/PNEUMONIA/COVID-19). The diagnosis results are quite promising, with high accuracy and sensitivity values for all the cases.

"Background: COVID-19, which is accompanied by acute respiratory distress, multiple organ failure, and death, has spread worldwide much faster than previously thought. However, at present, it has limited treatments. Objective: To overcome this issue, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model of COVID-19, named EDRnet (ensemble learning model based on deep neural network and random forest models), to predict in-hospital mortality using a routine blood sample at the time of hospital admission. Methods: We selected 28 blood biomarkers and used the age and gender information of patients as model inputs. To improve the mortality prediction, we adopted an ensemble approach combining deep neural network and random forest models. We trained our model with a database of blood samples from 361 COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China, and applied it to 106 COVID-19 patients in three Korean medical institutions. Results: In the testing data sets, EDRnet provided high sensitivity (100%), specificity (91%), and accuracy (92%). To extend the number of patient data points, we developed a web application (BeatCOVID19) where anyone can access the model to predict mortality and can register his or her own blood laboratory results. Conclusions: Our new AI model, EDRnet, accurately predicts the mortality rate for COVID-19. It is publicly available and aims to help health care providers fight COVID-19 and improve patients’ outcomes. © Hoon Ko, Heewon Chung, Wu Seong Kang, Chul Park, Do Wan Kim, Seong Eun Kim, Chi Ryang Chung, Ryoung Eun Ko, Hooseok Lee, Jae Ho Seo, Tae-Young Choi, Rafael Jaimes, Kyung Won Kim, Jinseok Lee.",Artificial intelligence; Blood samples; COVID-19; Mortality prediction
"Background: Assigning meaningful probabilities of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk presents a diagnostic challenge across the continuum of care. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and clinically validate an adaptable, personalized diagnostic model to assist clinicians in ruling in and ruling out COVID-19 in potential patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of probabilistic, graphical, and machine learning models against a previously published benchmark model. Methods: We integrated patient symptoms and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on 13 symptoms and estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19-compatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over the course of 14 days starting in March 2020. Results: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (n=43, 78%) or cough (n=42, 77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11, 20%) or hospital care (n=44, 80%). In total, 51% (n=28) were female and 49% (n=27) were aged <60 years. Common comorbidities included diabetes (n=12, 22%), hypertension (n=15, 27%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and cardiovascular disease (n=7, 13%). Of these, 69% (n=38) were confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 20% (n=11) had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6%-84.2%, specificities of 58.8%-70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4%-71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices. Conclusions: Decision support models that incorporate symptoms and available test results can help providers diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infection in real-world settings. © Christopher D'Ambrosia, Henrik Christensen, Eliah Aronoff-Spencer.

"Soaring cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are pummeling the global health system. Overwhelmed health facilities have endeavored to mitigate the pandemic, but mortality of COVID-19 continues to increase. Here, we present a mortality risk prediction model for COVID-19 (MRPMC) that uses patients’ clinical data on admission to stratify patients by mortality risk, which enables prediction of physiological deterioration and death up to 20 days in advance. This ensemble model is built using four machine learning methods including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, and Neural Network. We validate MRPMC in an internal validation cohort and two external validation cohorts, where it achieves an AUC of 0.9621 (95% CI: 0.9464–0.9778), 0.9760 (0.9613–0.9906), and 0.9246 (0.8763–0.9729), respectively. This model enables expeditious and accurate mortality risk stratification of patients with COVID-19, and potentially facilitates more responsive health systems that are conducive to high risk COVID-19 patients. © 2020, The Author(s).",
"Data-driven deep learning (DL) methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) demonstrate promising performance in natural image computer vision tasks. However, their use in medical computer vision tasks faces several limitations, viz., (i) adapting to visual characteristics that are unlike natural images; (ii) modeling random noise during training due to stochastic optimization and backpropagation-based learning strategy; (iii) challenges in explaining DL black-box behavior to support clinical decision-making; and (iv) inter-reader variability in the ground truth (GT) annotations affecting learning and evaluation. This study proposes a systematic approach to address these limitations through application to the pandemic-caused need for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). Specifically, our contribution highlights significant benefits obtained through (i) pretraining specific to CXRs in transferring and fine-tuning the learned knowledge toward improving COVID-19 detection performance; (ii) using ensembles of the fine-tuned models to further improve performance over individual constituent models; (iii) performing statistical analyses at various learning stages for validating results; (iv) interpreting learned individual and ensemble model behavior through class-selective relevance mapping (CRM)-based region of interest (ROI) localization; and, (v) analyzing inter-reader variability and ensemble localization performance using Simultaneous Truth and Performance Level Estimation (STAPLE) methods. We find that ensemble approaches markedly improved classification and localization performance, and that inter-reader variability and performance level assessment helps guide algorithm design and parameter optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to construct ensembles, perform ensemble-based disease ROI localization, and analyze inter-reader variability and algorithm performance for COVID-19 detection in CXRs.

"Background: COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19), a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Over 15 million people have already been affected worldwide by COVID-19, resulting in more than 0.6 million deaths. Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) play a key role in the cellular process of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in the human body. Recently a study has reported some SARS-CoV-2 proteins that interact with several human proteins while many potential interactions remain to be identified. Method: In this article, various machine learning models are built to predict the PPIs between the virus and human proteins that are further validated using biological experiments. The classification models are prepared based on different sequence-based features of human proteins like amino acid composition, pseudo amino acid composition, and conjoint triad. Result: We have built an ensemble voting classifier using SVMRadial, SVMPolynomial, and Random Forest technique that gives a greater accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, and F1 score compared to all other models used in the work. A total of 1326 potential human target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been predicted by the proposed ensemble model and validated using gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. Several repurposable drugs targeting the predicted interactions are also reported. Conclusion: This study may encourage the identification of potential targets for more effective anti-COVID drug discovery. © 2020 Chang Gung University",Classifier ensemble; COVID-19; Machine learning; Protein–protein interaction; SARS-CoV-2; Supervised classification
"COVID-19 is a vital zoonotic illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 is a very wide-spread among humans thus the early detection and curing of the disease offers a high opportunity of survival for patients. Computed Tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. As chest radiography can give an indicator of coronavirus. Though, an automated Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) system for COVID-19 based on chest X-Ray image analysis is presented in this article. It is designed for COVID-19 recognition from other MERS, SARS, and ARDS viral pneumonia. The optimal threshold value for the segmentation of a chest image is deduced by exploiting Li s' method and particle swarm intelligence. Laws' masks are then applied to the segmented chest image for secondary characteristics highlighting. After that, nine different vectors of attributes are extracted from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) representation of each Law's mask result. Support vector machine ensemble models are then built based on the extracted feature vectors. Finally, a weighted voting method is utilized to combine the decisions of ensemble classifiers. Experimental findings show an accuracy of 98.04 %. It indicates that the suggested CAD scheme can be a promising supplementary COVID-19 diagnostic tool for clinical doctors. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.",Chest x-ray; COVID-19; Gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM); Laws' masks; Li s'method; Particle swarm intelligence; Support vector machine (SVM); Weighted voting
"In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a nationwide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 transmission in India. To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R0). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R0. Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (Rt) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",COVID-19; Lockdown effect; Mathematical model; Outbreak containment policy
"The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has spread rapidly all over the world. The standard test for screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. As this method is time consuming, as an alternative, chest X-rays may be considered for quick screening. However, specialization is required to read COVID-19 chest X-ray images as they vary in features. To address this, we present a multi-channel pre-trained ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray. Three ResNet-based models were retrained to classify X-rays in a one-against-all basis from (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19 individuals. Finally, these three models were ensembled and fine-tuned using X-rays from 1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and 184 COVID-19 individuals to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases in a one-against-one framework. Our results show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single model as it extracts more relevant semantic features for each class. The method provides a precision of 94% and a recall of 100%. It could potentially help clinicians in screening patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for better outcomes. © 2020 by the authors.",Classification; COVID-19; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Transfer learning; X-ray
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely infectious disease and possibly causes acute respiratory distress or in severe cases may lead to death. There has already been some research in dealing with coronavirus using machine learning algorithms, but few have presented a truly comprehensive view. In this research, we show how convolutional neural network (CNN) can be useful to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. We leverage the CNN-based pre-trained models as feature extractors to substantiate transfer learning and add our own classifier in detecting COVID-19. In this regard, we evaluate performance of five different pre-trained models with fine-tuning the weights from some of the top layers. We also develop an ensemble model where the predictions from all chosen pre-trained models are combined to generate a single output. The models are evaluated through 5-fold cross validation using two publicly available data repositories containing healthy and infected (both COVID-19 and other pneumonia) chest X-ray images. We also leverage two different visualization techniques to observe how efficiently the models extract important features related to the detection of COVID-19 patients. The models show high degree of accuracy, precision, and sensitivity. We believe that the models will aid medical professionals with improved and faster patient screening and pave a way to further COVID-19 research. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

"The new Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an emerging disease responsible for infecting millions of people since the first notification until nowadays. Developing efficient short-term forecasting models allow forecasting the number of future cases. In this context, it is possible to develop strategic planning in the public health system to avoid deaths. In this paper, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), cubist regression (CUBIST), random forest (RF), ridge regression (RIDGE), support vector regression (SVR), and stacking-ensemble learning are evaluated in the task of time series forecasting with one, three, and six-days ahead the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases in ten Brazilian states with a high daily incidence. In the stacking-ensemble learning approach, the CUBIST regression, RF, RIDGE, and SVR models are adopted as base-learners and Gaussian process (GP) as meta-learner. The models’ effectiveness is evaluated based on the improvement index, mean absolute error, and symmetric mean absolute percentage error criteria. In most of the cases, the SVR and stacking-ensemble learning reach a better performance regarding adopted criteria than compared models. In general, the developed models can generate accurate forecasting, achieving errors in a range of 0.87%–3.51%, 1.02%–5.63%, and 0.95%–6.90% in one, three, and six-days-ahead, respectively. The ranking of models, from the best to the worst regarding accuracy, in all scenarios is SVR, stacking-ensemble learning, ARIMA, CUBIST, RIDGE, and RF models. The use of evaluated models is recommended to forecasting and monitor the ongoing growth of COVID-19 cases, once these models can assist the managers in the decision-making support systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",ARIMA; COVID-19; Decision-making; Forecasting; Machine learning; Time-series
"Background and objectives: The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted human society with a massive death toll worldwide. There is an urgent need for early and reliable screening of COVID-19 patients to provide better and timely patient care and to combat the spread of the disease. In this context, recent studies have reported some key advantages of using routine blood tests for initial screening of COVID-19 patients. In this article, first we present a review of the emerging techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis using routine laboratory and/or clinical data. Then, we propose ERLX which is an ensemble learning model for COVID-19 diagnosis from routine blood tests. Method: The proposed model uses three well-known diverse classifiers, extra trees, random forest and logistic regression, which have different architectures and learning characteristics at the first level, and then combines their predictions by using a second level extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to achieve a better performance. For data preparation, the proposed methodology employs a KNNImputer algorithm to handle null values in the dataset, isolation forest (iForest) to remove outlier data, and a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to balance data distribution. For model interpretability, features importance are reported by using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique. Results: The proposed model was trained and evaluated by using a publicly available data set from Albert Einstein Hospital in Brazil, which consisted of 5644 data samples with 559 confirmed COVID-19 cases. The ensemble model achieved outstanding performance with an overall accuracy of 99.88% [95% CI: 99.6–100], AUC of 99.38% [95% CI: 97.5–100], a sensitivity of 98.72% [95% CI: 94.6–100] and a specificity of 99.99% [95% CI: 99.99–100]. Discussion: The proposed model revealed better performance when compared against existing state-of-the-art studies (Banerjee et al., 2020; de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020; de Moraes Batista et al., 2020; Soares et al., 2020) [3,22,56,71] for the same set of features employed by them. As compared to the best performing Bayes Net model (de Freitas Barbosa et al., 2020) [22] average accuracy of 95.159%, ERLX achieved an average accuracy of 99.94%. In comparison with AUC of 85% reported by the SVM model (de Moraes Batista et al., 2020) [56], ERLX obtained AUC of 99.77% in addition to improvements in sensitivity, and specificity. As compared with ER-COV model (Soares et al., 2020) [71] average sensitivity of 70.25% and specificity of 85.98%, ERLX model achieved sensitivity of 99.47% and specificity of 99.99%. The ERLX model obtained a considerably higher score as compared with ANN model (Banerjee et al., 2020) [3] in all performance metrics. Therefore, the model presented is robust and can be deployed for reliable early and rapid screening of COVID-19 patients. © 2020 The Author(s)",COVID-19; Diagnostic model; Ensemble; Machine learning; Routine blood tests
"Online social networks (ONSs) such as Twitter have grown to be very useful tools for the dissemination of information. However, they have also become a fertile ground for the spread of false information, particularly regarding the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Best described as an infodemic, there is a great need, now more than ever, for scientific fact-checking and misinformation detection regarding the dangers posed by these tools with regards to COVID-19. In this article, we analyze the credibility of information shared on Twitter pertaining the COVID-19 pandemic. For our analysis, we propose an ensemble-learning-based framework for verifying the credibility of a vast number of tweets. In particular, we carry out analyses of a large dataset of tweets conveying information regarding COVID-19. In our approach, we classify the information into two categories: credible or non-credible. Our classifications of tweet credibility are based on various features, including tweet- and user-level features. We conduct multiple experiments on the collected and labeled dataset. The results obtained with the proposed framework reveal high accuracy in detecting credible and non-credible tweets containing COVID-19 information. © 2013 IEEE.",Classification; COVID-19; machine learning; misinformation; Twitter
"We demonstrate use of iteratively pruned deep learning model ensembles for detecting pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 with chest X-rays. This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions. We expect that this model can be quickly adopted for COVID-19 screening using chest radiographs. © 2013 IEEE.",convolutional neural network; COVID-19; deep learning; ensemble; iterative pruning
